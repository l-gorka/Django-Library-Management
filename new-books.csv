Carlotta R. Anderson,Hardcover,"""All-American Anarchist"" chronicles the life and work of Joseph A. Labadie (1850-1933), Detroit's prominent labor organizer and one of early labor's most influential activists. A dynamic participant in the major social reform movements of the Gilded Age, Labadie was a central figure in the pervasive struggle for a new social order as the American Midwest underwent rapid industrialization at the end of the 19th century. This engaging biography follows Labadie's colorful career from a childhood among a Pottawatomi tribe in the Michigan woods through his local and national involvement in a maze of late 19th-century labor and reform activities, including participation in the Socialist Labor party, Knights of Labor, Greenback movement, trades councils, typographical union, eight-hour-day campaigns, and the rise of the American Federation of Labor. In writing this biography of her grandfather, Carlotta R. Anderson consulted the renowned Labadie Collection at the University of Michigan, a unique collection of protest literature which extensively documents pivotal times in American labor history and radical history.","Labor,History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356461214l/1001079.jpg,814327079,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001079.All_American_Anarchist,324,3.83,1,All-American Anarchist: Joseph A.

Jeffrey Pfeffer,Hardcover,"Why is common sense so uncommon when it comes to managing people? How is it that so many seemingly intelligent organizations implement harmful management practices and ideas? In his provocative new book, ,The Human Equation,, bestselling author Jeffrey Pfeffer examines why much of the current conventional wisdom is wrong and asks us to re-think the way managers link people with organizational performance. Pfeffer masterfully builds a powerful business case for managing people effectively—not just because it makes for good corporate policy, but because it results in outstanding performance and profits. Challenging current thinking and practice, Pfeffer: reveals the costs of downsizing and provides alternatives; identifies troubling trends in compensation, and suggests better practices; explains why even the smartest managers sometimes manage people unwisely; demonstrates how market-based forces can fail to create good people management practices, creating a need for positive public policy; and provides practical guidelines for implementing high-performance management practices. Filled with information and ideas, ,The Human Equation, provides much-needed guidance for managing people more wisely and more profitably.","Business,Leadership,Romance,Historical Romance,Nonfiction,Business,Management,Management,Human Resources",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1400939083l/1001090.jpg,875848419,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001090.The_Human_Equation,368,3.73,7,The Human Equation: Building Profits by Putting People First,119
Jeffrey Pfeffer,Paperback,"""Competitive Advantage Through People"" explores why - despite long-standing evidence that a committed work force is essential for success - firms continue to attach little importance to their workers. The answer, argues Pfeffer, resides in a complex web of factors based on perception, history, legislation, and practice that continues to dominate management thought and action. Yet, some organizations have been able to overcome these obstacles. In fact, the five common stocks with the highest returns between 1972 and 1992 - Southwest Airlines, Wal-Mart, Tyson Foods, Circuit City, and Plenum Publishing - were in industries that shared virtually none of the characteristics traditionally associated with strategic success. What each of these firms did share is the ability to produce sustainable competitive advantage through its way of managing people. Pfeffer documents how they - and others - resisted traditional management pitfalls, and offers frameworks for implementing these changes in any industry.","Business,Leadership,Business,Management,Romance,Historical Romance",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387741596l/1001092.jpg,087584717X,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001092.Competitive_Advantage_Through_People,304,3.65,1,Competitive Advantage Through People: Unleashing the Power of the Work Force,20

Nick Le Neve Walmsley,Paperback,"At the time of her construction in the late 1920s, His Majesty's Airship R101 was the largest flying object ever made—as big and luxurious as an ocean liner, a Titanic of the skies designed to link the far-flung corners of the British Empire within days. As Britain recovered from the horrors of the trenches, R101's graceful lines, vast size, and luxurious accommodation came to represent the supreme self-confidence and hopes of a nation. But that unclouded vision was fatally colored by personal ambition, heroism, weakness, and political intrigue that touched many lives and reached a terrible climax on a storm-lashed hillside in France in the early hours of October 5, 1930. This book is the first to tell her story through contemporary photographs and actual material used during her construction. By returning to original sources, Nick Walmsley challenges the long-held view that R101 was a bad aircraft built by careless people. Atmospherically capturing the heady days of the 1920s, ,R101: A Pictorial History, has wide appeal to aviation enthusiasts, social historians, and anyone fascinated by a tale of an heroic dream with a horrific end.",,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328818548l/10011431.jpg,752456830,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10011431-r101,160,5,2,R101: A Pictorial History,3

Mark Verman,Paperback,"The earliest medieval Jewish mystical writings, or kabbalah, date from the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries. This is the first book to focus on the most prodigious group active at that time--the 'Circle of Contemplation'.,The 'Circle of Contemplation' generated a mystical theology that differs radically from mainstream kabbalistic theosophy. Two of this group's penetrating speculations on God and the origins of the universe are The Book of Contemplation and The Fountain of Wisdom. A meticulous and systematic study of these writings forms the core of this book.,Verman discovered that the 'Circle of Contemplation' produced a series of distinct treatises, each entitled The Book of Contemplation and attributed to the same fictitious author. These treatises, embodying one of the most intriguing puzzles of medieval literature, are included here.,The author concludes that these writings were a product of thirteenth-century Spain, not France, as claimed by Gershom Scholem. His conclusion engendered a critical evaluation of the premises of Scholem's historiography of early medieval Jewish mysticism.",,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1527071079l/10011932.jpg,791407209,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10011932-the-books-of-contemplation,282,4.75,1,The Books of Contemplation: Medieval Jewish Mystical Sources,4

In doing so he also unravels the many theoretical strategies in the study of religion that have been developed and explored by later anthropologists. Besides discussing the classical authors and the debates surrounding their work, Morris presents perceptive accounts of more contemporary scholars such as Jung, Malinowski, Levi-Strauss, Geertz, and Godelier.

Richard Layard,Paperback,"There is a paradox at the heart of our lives. We all want more money, but as societies become richer, they do not become happier. This is not speculation: It's the story told by countless pieces of scientific research. We now have sophisticated ways of measuring how happy people are, and all the evidence shows that on average people have grown no happier in the last fifty years, even as average incomes have more than doubled.The central question the great economist Richard Layard asks in ,Happiness, is this: If we really wanted to be happier, what would we do differently? First we'd have to see clearly what conditions generate happiness and then bend all our efforts toward producing them. That is what this book is about-the causes of happiness and the means we have to effect it.,Until recently there was too little evidence to give a good answer to this essential question, but, Layard shows us, thanks to the integrated insights of psychology, sociology, applied economics, and other fields, we can now reach some firm conclusions, conclusions that will surprise you. ,Happiness, is an illuminating road map, grounded in hard research, to a better, happier life for us all.","Psychology,Nonfiction,Economics,Science,Philosophy,Self Help,Self Help,Personal Development,Sociology,Writing,Journalism,Politics",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309287208l/100120.jpg,143037013,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100120.Happiness,320,3.73,85,Happiness: Lessons from a New Science,924

Philip Mansel,Hardcover,"Throughout history rulers have used clothes as a form of legitimization and propaganda. While palaces, pictures, and jewels might reflect the choice of a monarch’s predecessors or advisers, clothes reflected the preferences of the monarch himself. Being both personal and visible, the right costume at the right time could transform and define a monarch’s reputation. Many royal leaders have known this, from Louis XIV to Catherine the Great and from Napoleon I to Princess Diana.,This intriguing book explores how rulers have sought to control their image through their appearance. Mansel shows how individual styles of dress throw light on the personalities of particular monarchs, on their court system, and on their ambitions. The book looks also at the economics of the costume industry, at patronage, at the etiquette involved in mourning dress, and at the act of dressing itself. Fascinating glimpses into the lives of European monarchs and contemporary potentates reveal the intimate connection between power and the way it is packaged.","History,Couture,Fashion,Nonfiction,Historical,Cultural,France",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328871490l/1001221.jpg,300106971,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001221.Dressed_to_Rule,256,3.58,5,Dressed to Rule: Royal and Court Costume from Louis XIV to Elizabeth II,24
Umberto Eco,Hardcover,"In the course of the long debate on the nature and the classification of signs, from Boethius to Ockham, there are at least three lines of thought: the Stoic heritage, that influences Augustine, Abelard, Francis Bacon; the Aristotelian tradition, stemming from the commentaries on ,De Interpretatione;, the discussion of the grammarians, from Priscian to the Modistae. Modern interpreters are frequently misled by the fact that the various authors regularly used the same terms. Such a homogeneous terminology, however, covers profound theoretical differences. The aim of these essays is to show that the medieval theory of signs does not represent a unique body of semiotic notions: there are diverse and frequently alternative semiotic theories. This book thus represents an attempt to encourage further research on the still unrecognized variety of the semiotic approaches offered by the medieval philosophies of language.",History,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1362957934l/1001231.jpg,9027232938,9790000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001231.On_The_Medieval_Theory_Of_Signs,0,4.1,0,On The Medieval Theory Of Signs,10

"Christopher Peterson,Martin E.P. Seligman",Hardcover,"Character has become a front-and-center topic in contemporary discourse, but this term does not have a fixed meaning. Character may be simply defined by what someone does not do, but a more active and thorough definition is necessary, one that addresses certain vital questions. Is character a singular characteristic of an individual, or is it composed of different aspects? Does character--however we define it--exist in degrees, or is it simply something one happens to have? How can character be developed? Can it be learned? Relatedly, can it be taught, and who might be the most effective teacher? What roles are played by family, schools, the media, religion, and the larger culture? This groundbreaking handbook of character strengths and virtues is the first progress report from a prestigious group of researchers who have undertaken the systematic classification and measurement of widely valued positive traits. They approach good character in terms of separate strengths-authenticity, persistence, kindness, gratitude, hope, humor, and so on-each of which exists in degrees.,Character Strengths and Virtues, classifies twenty-four specific strengths under six broad virtues that consistently emerge across history and culture: wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and transcendence. Each strength is thoroughly examined in its own chapter, with special attention to its meaning, explanation, measurement, causes, correlates, consequences, and development across the life span, as well as to strategies for its deliberate cultivation.

"Fernando Henrique Cardoso,Brian Winter",Paperback,"Fernando Henrique Cardoso received a phone call in the middle of the night asking him to be the new Finance Minister of Brazil. As he put the phone down and stared into the darkness of his hotel room, he feared he'd been handed a political death sentence. The year was 1993, and he would be responsible for an economy that had had seven different currencies in the previous eight years to cope with inflation that had run at 3000 percent a year. Brazil had a habit of chewing up finance ministers with the ferocity of an Amazon piranha. This was just one of the turns in a largely unscripted and sometimes unwanted political career. In exile during the harshest period of the junta that ruled Brazil for twenty years, Cardoso started his political life with a tentative run for the Federal Senate in 1978. Within fifteen years, and despite himself, this former sociologist was running the country.,And what a country! Brazil, it is often said, is on the edge of modernity, striding with one foot in mid-air towards the future, the other still rooted deep in a traditional past. It is a land of sophisticated music and brutal gold-digging, of the next global superpower and the last old-time coffee plantations. It is gloriously ungovernable, irrepressibly attractive, and home to the family, friends and extraordinary life of Fernando Henrique Cardoso. This is his story and his love song to his country.","History,Cultural,Brazil,Nonfiction,Biography,Politics,Autobiography,Memoir,Economics,Culture,Society",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1437014640l/1001322._SY475_.jpg,1586483242,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001322.The_Accidental_President_of_Brazil,291,4.14,42,The Accidental President of Brazil: A Memoir,416
Gustavo Gorriti,Paperback,"First published in Peru in 1990, ,The Shining Path, was immediately hailed as one of the finest works on the insurgency that plagued that nation for over fifteen years. A richly detailed and absorbing account, it covers the dramatic years between the guerrillas' opening attack in 1980 and President Fernando Belaunde's reluctant decision to send in the military to contain the growing rebellion in late 1982. Covering the strategy, actions, successes, and setbacks of both the government and the rebels, the book shows how the tightly organized insurgency forced itself upon an unwilling society just after the transition from an authoritarian to a democratic regime.,One of Peru's most distinguished journalists, Gustavo Gorriti first covered the Shining Path movement for the leading Peruvian newsweekly, ,Caretas,. Drawing on hundreds of interviews and an impressive array of government and Shining Path documents, he weaves his careful research into a vivid portrait of the now-jailed Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman, Belaunde and his generals, and the unfolding drama of the fiercest war fought on Peruvian soil since the Chilean invasion a century before.","History,Nonfiction,Politics",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348583091l/1001325.jpg,807846767,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001325.The_Shining_Path,318,3.95,10,The Shining Path: A History of the Millenarian War in Peru,120
Marilyn Butler,Paperback,"It is often said that Jane Austen in the countryside remained isolated from the great events of her time. But as Marilyn Butler points out in ,Jane Austen and the War of Ideas,, Austen was not isolated from reading novels, and novels carried controversy. The sentimental novel of the previous generation, the Jacobin novel of William Godwin, the philosophical comedy of Robert Bage and Maria Edgeworth--all conveyed their own kind of ideological meaning. By recognizing Austen's relationship to the literature of ideas, Butler offers acute readings of each of the novels and an intellectual context in which to see them as a whole.","Criticism,Literary Criticism,Nonfiction,Criticism,Language,Writing,Literature,History,Biography",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1420787916l/1001337.jpg,198129688,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001337.Jane_Austen_and_the_War_of_Ideas,356,3.96,6,Jane Austen and the War of Ideas,52

"Leo Bagrow,Raleigh Ashlin Skelton",Hardcover,"This illustrated work is intended to acquaint readers with the early maps produced in both Europe and the rest of the world, and to tell us something of their development, their makers and printers, their varieties and characteristics. The authors' chief concern is with the appearance of maps: they exclude any examination of their content, or of scientific methods of mapmaking. This book ends in the second half of the eighteenth century, when craftsmanship was superseded by specialized science and the machine. As a history of the evolution of the early map, it is a stunning work of art and science.,This expanded second edition of Bagrow and Skelton's ,History of Cartography, marks the reappearance of this seminal work after a hiatus of nearly a half century. As a reprint project undertaken many years after the book last appeared, finding suitable materials to work from proved to be no easy task. Because of the wealth of monochrome and color plates, the book could only be properly reproduced using the original materials. Ultimately the authors were able to obtain materials from the original printer Scotchprints or contact films made directly from original plates, thus allowing the work to preserve the beauty and clarity of the illustrations.,Old maps, collated with other materials, help us to elucidate the course of human history. It was not until the eighteenth century, however, that maps were gradually stripped of their artistic decoration and transformed into plain, specialist sources of information based upon measurement. Maps are objects of historical, artistic, and cultural significance, and thus collecting them seems to need no justification, simply enjoyment.",,,913750336,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10013570-history-of-cartography,312,5,0,History of Cartography: Enlarged Second Edition,1
B. Mark Smith,Paperback,"The stock market is big news today. Over 50 percent of the American public own stocks directly or indirectly, meaning that the financial well-being of tens of millions of people is directly tied to the market. Alan Greenspan has stated that it is not possible to understand the modern economy without understanding the stock market. But this has not always been so. ,Many people now alive can remember a very different time, when the stock market was little more than a primitive insiders' game, viewed by most Americans with skepticism and suspicion. In ,Toward Rational Exuberance,, B. Mark Smith, a professional stock trader with two decades of practical experience, tells the story of how this stunning transformation occurred. It is a fascinating story, involving colorful personalities, dramatic events, and revolutionary new ideas. In the course of the narrative, Smith traces the evolution of popular theories of stock market behavior, showing how they have greatly influenced the way the investing public views the market. But he also shows how some of these theories are based on faulty interpretations of market history that may lead investors astray. Freshly updated, this is a timely -- and definitive -- account of the market's true history and dangerous myths.","Economics,Finance,Economics,History,Finance,Personal Finance,Nonfiction,Currency,Money,Business,Menage,M M M",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1311994684l/100135.jpg,374528500,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100135.Toward_Rational_Exuberance,352,3.73,3,Toward Rational Exuberance: The Evolution of the Modern Stock Market,44

"Carly Mine,Carly Mine",Paperback,"When adult entertainment first appeared on the pop culture radar as an underground film phenomenon, women were little more than starlets, who—for the most part—answered to men. But as pornography evolved in step with technology and consumer demand over the past twenty years, it also reflected the shifting political climate. Greater sexual equality started to appear both in front of and behind the cameras. Not only did female performers take charge for the first time of their careers, but women began running the companies people purchase movies from, opening woman-friendly sex shops and writing thoughtful, analytical commentary on pornography-often from a feminist perspective.,In ,Naked Ambition,, adult entertainment industry insider Carly Milne takes readers behind the scenes and on to the frontlines of today's woman-owned and supported adult entertainment industry that has revolutionized both pornography and the traditional feminist movement that has for years often stood in opposition to it. Personal essays by Jenna Jameson, Theresa Flynt, Violet Blue, Holly Randall, Tristan Taormino, Tera Patrick, Danni Ashe, Nina Hartley, Jane Duvall and Rachel Kramer Bussel, among other top women pornographers and pornography supporters showcase this relatively recent but fast-growing segment of adult entertainment producers and consumers.","Nonfiction,Sociology,Sexuality,Sex Work,Feminism,Sexuality,Gender,GLBT,Queer",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348423970l/1001379.jpg,786715901,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001379.Naked_Ambition,340,3.54,2,Naked Ambition: Women Who Are Changing Pornography,46
Martin Evans,Hardcover,"Invaded in 1830, populated by one million settlers who co-existed uneasily with nine million Arabs and Berbers, Algeria was different from other French colonies because it was administered as an integral part of France, in theory no different from Normandy or Brittany. The depth and scale of the colonization process explains why the Algerian War of 1954 to 1962 was one of the longest and most violent of the decolonization struggles.,An undeclared war in the sense that there was no formal beginning of hostilities, the war produced huge tensions that brought down four governments, ended the Fourth Republic in 1958, and mired the French army in accusations of torture and mass human rights abuses. In carefully re-examining the origins and consequences of the conflict, Martin Evans argues that it was the Socialist led Republican Front, in power from January 1956 until May 1957, which was the defining moment in the war. Predicated on the belief in the universal civilizing mission of the Fourth Republic, coupled with the conviction that Algerian nationalism was feudal and religiously fanatical in character, the Republican Front dramatically intensified the war in the spring of 1956.,Drawing upon previously classified archival sources as well as new oral testimonies, this book underlines the conflict of values between the Republican Front and Algerian nationalism, explaining how this clash produced patterns of thought and action, such as the institutionalization of torture and the raising of pro-French Muslim militias, which tragically polarized choices and framed all subsequent stages of the conflict.","History,Cultural,Africa,Northern Africa,Algeria,Cultural,France,Nonfiction,Religion,Islam,Military,Military History,Africa,Northern Africa",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348010302l/10013840.jpg,192803506,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10013840-algeria,457,4.3,6,Algeria: France's Undeclared War,90
Jerome Murphy-O'Connor,Paperback,"For someone who has exercised such a profound influence on Christian theology, Paul remains a shadowy figure behind the barrier of his complicated and difficult biblical letters. Debates about his meaning have deflected attention from his personality, yet his personality is an important key to understanding his theological ideas. This book redresses the balance. Jerome Murphy-O'Connor's disciplined imagination, nourished by a lifetime of research, shapes numerous textual, historical, and archaeological details into a colourful and enjoyable story of which Paul is the flawed but undefeated hero., This chronological narrative offers new insights into Paul's intellectual, emotional, and religious development and puts his travels, mission, and theological ideas into a plausible biographical context. As he changes from an assimilated Jewish teenager in Tarsus to a competitive Pharisee in Jerusalem and then to a driven missionary of Christ, the sometimes contradictory components of Paul's complex personality emerge from the way he interacts with people and problems. His theology was forged in dialogue and becomes more intelligible as our appreciation of his person deepens. In Jerome Murphy-O'Connor's engaging biography, the Apostle comes to life as a complex, intensely human individual.","Religion,Religion,Theology,Christianity,New Testament",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348064280l/1001384.jpg,199283842,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001384.Paul,259,3.73,9,Paul: His Story,56
Sumpter Priddy,Hardcover,"Between 1790 and 1840, millions of middle-class Americans throughout the nation encountered ""Fancy"": they rode in a Fancy sleigh, dressed up in Fancy clothes, blew their noses in Fancy handkerchiefs, bought goods at Fancy shops, ate at Fancy tables on Fancy dishes, and slept under Fancy coverlets. Not just fancy but Fancy: an early nineteenth-century cultural phenomenon born out of new and enlightened ways of seeing, understanding, and responding to the surrounding world. Fancy expressed itself in just about everything that pleased the senses; generally colorful and boldly patterned, it elicited delight, awe, surprise, whim, and caprice. Whether experienced in the form of painted surfaces, kaleidoscopic quilts, or imaginary landscapes, Fancy engaged the emotions and expanded the imagination, expressing the core of human fancy. ""American Fancy"" offers an appropriately fantastic experience of this uniquely American sensibility. Author Sumpter Priddy has assembled and produced an original oeuvre in the field of decorative arts, going beyond the traditional modes of furniture analysis, which concentrate on style, history, and construction, to consider the perceptual and emotional responses through which the original users and viewers would have interacted with these material things. To this end he employs the interpretive methods used in the fields of literature, fine arts, philosophy and even psychology. Rich, fully illustrated, wondrously researched, and bound in a cover that imitates a typical Fancy pattern, ""American Fancy"" does its marvelous subject true.",,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348341234l/100139.jpg,972435395,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100139.American_Fancy,267,4.13,0,American Fancy: Exuberance in the Arts 1790-1840,8

Janice G. Raymond,Paperback,"Fifteen years ago, when it was first published, ""The Transsexual Empire"" challenged the medical psychiatric definition of transsexualism as a disease and sex conversion hormones and surgery as the cure. It exposed the antifeminist stereotyping that requires candidates for transsexual surgery to prove themselves by conforming to subjective, outdated and questionable feminine roles and ""passing"" as women. Then as now, defining and treating transsexualism as a medical problem prevents the person experiencing so-called gender dissatisfaction from seeing it in a gender-challenging or feminist framework. Transsexualism goes to the question of what gender is, how to challenge it, and what reinforces gender stereotyping in a role-defined society. In the new introduction to this feminist work, Raymond discusses how these same issues are now debated in the context of transgender. Transgenderism reduces gender resistance to wardrobes, hormones, surgery and posturing - anything but real sexual equality. It assimilates the roles and definitions of masculinity and femininity, often mixing and matching, but never really moving beyond both.,In a similar way, transsexualism is thought to be a radical challenge to gender roles, breaking the boundaries of gender and transgressing its rigid lines. But if the transsexual merely exchanges one gender role for another, and if the outcome of such a sex reassignment is to endorse a femininity which, in many transsexuals, becomes a caricature of much that feminists have rejected about many-made femininity, then where is the challenge, the transgression, and the breaking of any real boundaries? This book will be used as a text in women's studies, psychology, sociology, technology and public policy, as well as by medical students, law students, and all who have an interest in feminist issues.","Feminism,Nonfiction,Gender,GLBT,Queer,LGBT,LGBT,Transgender,Psychology,Philosophy,Politics,Social",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1346281085l/1001441.jpg,807762725,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001441.The_Transsexual_Empire,264,2.83,47,The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male,198

Richard L. Kagan,Hardcover,"This engrossing book examines the particular importance of cities in Spanish and Hispanic-American culture as well as the different meanings that artists and cartographers invested in their depiction of New and Old World cities and towns. Kagan maintains that cities are both built structures and human communities, and that representations of the urban form reflect both points of view. He discusses the peculiar character of Spain's ""empire of towns""; the history and development of the cityscape as an independent artistic genre, both in Europe and in the Americas; the interaction between European and native mapping traditions; differences between European maps of urban America and those produced by local residents, whether native or creole; and the urban iconography of four different New World towns.

Richard L. Kagan,Hardcover,"Setting aside the pastiche of bullfighters and flamenco dancers that has dominated the U.S. image of Spain for more than a century, this innovative volume uncovers the roots of Spanish studies to explain why the diversity, vitality, and complexity of Spanish history and culture have been reduced in U.S. accounts to the equivalent of a tourist brochure.,  , Spurred by the complex colonial relations between the United States and Spain, the new field of Spanish studies offered a way for the young country to reflect a positive image of itself as a democracy, in contrast with perceived Spanish intolerance and closure. Spain in America investigates the political and historical forces behind this duality, surveying the work of the major nineteenth-century U.S. Hispanists in the fields of history, art history, literature, and music., A distinguished panel of contributors offers fresh examinations of the role of U.S. writers, especially Washington Irving and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, in crafting a wildly romantic vision of Spain.,  They examine the views of such scholars as William H. Prescott and George Ticknor, who contrasted the ""failure"" of Spanish history with U.S. exceptionalism. Other essays explore how U.S. interests in Latin America consistently colored its vision of Spain and how musicology in the United States, dominated by German émigrés, relegated Spanish music to little more than a footnote.

Black and White America are locked in the tense grip of massive change. Into this inferno steps an unsuspecting young White couple.

If you like to read, you'll love ""Ain't No Tomorrow,"""",--Sylvester Stallone. .,At the start of the 2000 NBA playoffs, the famously underachieving Los Angeles Lakers found themselves the focus of national attention. The team that had limped along since the golden era of Magic Johnson was now endowed with basketball's two most gifted and dominant players, Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, and was led by none other than Phil Jackson, the most fabled coach in the NBA. By the time the Lakers beat Indiana in game six of the championship series, they showed themselves unstoppable, a team above and apart and blessed with a glamour and facility that made them the obvious franchise to lead pro basketball into the new millennium.. .,Then everything began to fall apart. Jackson had warned his team that the truly challenging season is the one ""after ""an initial big win, and his words were quickly becoming reality as the great team slipped into profound disarray at the start of the new season. ""Ain't No Tomorrow ""is an intimate look at the astonishing eight-month roller-coaster ride that became the Lakers' 2000-2001 season: a time of tumult and drama when impulses toward brotherhood and unity dissolved into petty, uglybattles and bruised egos; when men who previously rose to a great challenge grew greedy and slack.. .,Combining brilliant reporting and original perspective, Elizabeth Kaye--a journalist granted special access to Jackson, Shaq, Kobe, and other major players--takes you into the minds and hearts of the team members.

RoxAnn Klugman,Hardcover,"In 1944 Anne Scheiber, a lifelong federal employee whose income never surpassed $3,150 a year -- yes, the figure is correct! -- invested $5,000 in blue-chip stocks. When she died in 1995 her stocks were worth $22 million -- that figure is also correct! -- and she was receiving an annual income of over $1 million in dividends from them. The Dividend Growth Investment Strategy tells how she did it and how others can invest long-term in stock for retirement income.Over half of all Americans have money in the stock market, most of it in mutual funds. But most mutual funds underperform the stock market, and they are taxed. The taxes and fees destroy compounding of investments and diminish the retirement nest egg. Anne Scheiber's method, the Dividend Growth Investment Strategy (DGIS), beats the mutual fund in returns fivefold after thirty years, though both approaches achieve 14 percent annual growth.,This book examines and compares the various investment strategies of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds and shows in hard figures why DGIS is the better investment strategy. The DGIS maximizes growth of the nest egg while producing income that doubles every five years. It also minimizes anxiety over market downturns and inflation because investors can ride the market ""roller coaster"" by keeping their capital growing, while riding the stock market ""escalator"" through dividend growth returns, all the while avoiding taxes on their dividends.,To help the investor choose stocks, company fundamentals are discussed along with suggestions on how to research them and what materials to use.","Economics,Finance,Finance,Personal Finance",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347623881l/1001916.jpg,806521821,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001916.The_Dividend_Growth_Investment_Strategy,290,4,1,The Dividend Growth Investment Strategy: How to Keep Your Retirement Income Doubling Every Five Years,13

Eithne Quinn,Paperback,"In the late 1980s, gangsta rap music emerged in urban America, giving voice to--and making money for--a social group widely considered to be in crisis: young, poor, black men. From its local origins, gangsta rap went on to flood the mainstream, generating enormous popularity and profits. Yet the highly charged lyrics, public battles, and hard, fast lifestyles that characterize the genre have incited the anger of many public figures and proponents of ""family values."" Constantly engaging questions of black identity and race relations, poverty and wealth, gangsta rap represents one of the most profound influences on pop culture in the last thirty years.,Focusing on the artists Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, the Geto Boys, Snoop Dogg, and Tupac Shakur, Quinn explores the origins, development, and immense appeal of gangsta rap. Including detailed readings in urban geography, neoconservative politics, subcultural formations, black cultural debates, and music industry conditions, this book explains how and why this music genre emerged. In ,Nuthin'but a ""G"" Thang,, Quinn argues that gangsta rap both reflected and reinforced the decline in black protest culture and the great rise in individualist and entrepreneurial thinking that took place in the U.S. after the 1970s. Uncovering gangsta rap's deep roots in black working-class expressive culture, she stresses the music's aesthetic pleasures and complexities that have often been ignored in critical accounts.","Music,Music,Hip Hop",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348110069l/1001929.jpg,231124090,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1001929.Nuthin_But_a_G_Thang,251,3.59,5,"Nuthin' But a ""G"" Thang: The Culture and Commerce of Gangsta Rap",39

Joe Klein,Paperback,"Perhaps now best known as an acclaimed (and bestselling) author of fiction, Joe Klein has for nearly three decades been one of contemporary journalism's premiere reporters. In ""Woody Guthrie: A Life"", Klein's signature style of insightful narrative nonfiction brings to life a vivid chapter in the history of American culture.,In 1998, the Woody Guthrie Foundation made public for the first time more than 10,000 of his papers, letters, song lyrics, and artworks, sparking renewed interest in the life of an American folk legend who influenced generations of musicians to come. The New York Times, reporting on the phenomenon, described Guthrie's appeal and legacy succinctly: ""(Woody Guthrie was) one of the most influential cultural figures of the century. Guthrie inspired Bob Dylan and virtually created the modern folk tradition and singer-songwriter genre, and his music remains as vital today as when he was performing"".,Born in Oklahoma in 1912, Guthrie spent his early years among the farmers and migrant workers of the dust bowl. As a young man during the Great Depression, he traveled across the country by boxcar with his guitar, composing the indelible folk ballads that made him a leader of the politically vital folk movement of the pre-war era. Tragically, the onset of Huntington's disease, gradually diminished his mind, body, and work, and led to his untimely death at the age of 55. Still, Guthrie's life and music have inspired every important folk and folk rock artist since, from Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, and Joan Baez to Bruce Springsteen, Billy Bragg, and Ani DiFranco.","Music,Biography,Nonfiction,History,Biography Memoir,Reference,Research,Adventure,Folklore,Autobiography,Memoir",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1417406926l/100213.jpg,385333854,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100213.Woody_Guthrie,512,4.33,97,Woody Guthrie,1267

Andrew Bradstock,Paperback,"""The present state of the old world is running up like parchment in the fire."" So declaimed Gerrard Winstanley, charismatic leader of radical religious group the Diggers, in mid-seventeenth century England: one of the most turbulent periods in that country's history. As three civil wars divided and slaughtered families and communities, as failing harvests and land reforms forced many to the edge of starvation, and as longstanding institutions like the House of Lords, the Established Church and even the monarchy were unceremoniously dismantled, so a feverish sense of living on the cusp of a new age gripped the nation. ,Radical Religion in Cromwell's England, is the first genuinely concise and accessible history of the fascinating ideas and popular movements which emerged during this volatile period. Names like the ""Ranters,"" ""Seekers,"" ""Diggers,"" ""Muggletonians"" and ""Levellers"" convey something of the exoticism of these associations, which although loose-knit, and in some cases short-lived, impacted on every stratum of society. Andrew Bradstock critically appraises each group and its ideas, taking into account the context in which they emerged, the factors which influenced them, and their significance at the time and subsequently. The role of political, religious, economic and military factors in shaping radical opinion is explored in full, as is the neglected contribution of women to these movements. Drawing on the author's long study of the topic, ,Radical Religion in Cromwell's England, brings a remarkable era to vivid and colorful life.",History,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1315694755l/10022889.jpg,1845117654,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10022889-radical-religion-in-cromwell-s-england,224,3.89,1,Radical Religion in Cromwell's England: A Concise History from the English Civil War to the End of the Commonwealth,9

Stephen C. Levinson,Paperback,"This is the first extended discussion of preferred interpretation in language understanding, integrating much of the best research in linguistic pragmatics from the last two decades.,When we speak, we mean more than we say. In this book Stephen C. Levinson explains some general processes that underlie presumptions in communication. This is the first extended discussion of preferred interpretation in language understanding, integrating much of the best research in linguistic pragmatics from the last two decades. Levinson outlines a theory of presumptive meanings, or preferred interpretations, governing the use of language, building on the idea of implicature developed by the philosopher H.P. Grice. Some of the indirect information carried by speech is presumed by default because it is carried by general principles, rather than inferred from specific assumptions about intention and context. Levinson examines this class of general pragmatic inferences in detail, showing how they apply to a wide range of linguistic constructions. This approach has radical consequences for how we think about language and communication.","Humanities,Linguistics,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347512848l/1002385.jpg,262621304,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1002385.Presumptive_Meanings,504,4.36,1,Presumptive Meanings: The Theory of Generalized Conversational Implicature,14

The informational interviews Larson conducted with the infamous master forger, Mark Hofmann, at Utah State Prison in the late 1980s lay the foundation for a number of methods revealed in this book.

Hubert Benoît,Paperback,"History and anthropology make it abundantly clear that societies composed of individuals who think, feel, believe and act according to the most preposterous conventions can survive for long periods of time. Statistical normality is perfectly compatible with a high degree of folly and wickedness. In so far as he is a psychotherapist, the Oriental philosopher tries to help statistically normal individuals to become normal in the other, more fundamental sense of the word. This process of intellectual and psycho-physical adjustment to the Nature of Things is the «supreme doctrine""­ of Zen Buddhism, which Dr Benoit discusses in the light of Western psychological theory and Western psychiatric practise. This is a book that should be read by everyone who aspires to know who he is and what he can do to acquire such self-knowledge. From the Foreword by Aldous Huxley The Supreme Doctrine is a cogent statement of what Zen thought had to offer the practising Western psychiatrist. This is a book which assuredly still speaks for itself. T. H.

"Maria Manzano,Samson Abramsky,C.J. van Rijsbergen",Paperback,"Classical logic has proved inadequate in various areas of computer science, artificial intelligence, mathematics, philosopy and linguistics. This is an introduction to extensions of first-order logic, based on the principle that many-sorted logic (MSL) provides a unifying framework in which to place, for example, second-order logic, type theory, modal and dynamic logics and MSL itself. The aim is two fold: only one theorem-prover is needed; proofs of the metaproperties of the different existing calculi can be avoided by borrowing them from MSL. To make the book accessible to readers from different disciplines, whilst maintaining precision, the author has supplied detailed step-by-step proofs, avoiding difficult arguments, and continually motivating the material with examples. Consequently this can be used as a reference, for self-teaching or for first-year graduate courses.","Philosophy,Logic",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348959040l/10024102.jpg,521019028,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10024102-extensions-of-first-order-logic,412,4.5,0,Extensions of First-Order Logic,2

Pauline Matarasso,Hardcover,"Queen's Mate tells the story of three remarkable women who shaped and presided over the destiny of France during the last years of the 15th century and the early part of the 16th: Anne of France, Anne of Brittany, and Louise of Savoy. Although each is worthy of her own individual biography, their lives were so enmeshed by kinship, marriage and circumstances as to be well served by a book that mirrors the complex interweaving of their lives. Their story is rich enough in dramatic incident to provide a gripping narrative, but the book looks also at the wider issues: at the restrictions, particularly in the exercise of power, placed on the three women by society; at their success in ignoring or pushing back those barriers; at what they wanted or expected for their daughters; and at how they saw themselves in relation to men. The study draws largely on contemporary sources, both printed and manuscript, and presents material hitherto unknown or overlooked. It is the first study of the three women as a group, and indeed is one of the first modern, reliable studies in English or French of any one of them as an individual.","Cultural,France,Biography",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1560869010l/1002467._SY475_.jpg,754603210,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1002467.Queen_s_Mate,332,5,2,Queen's Mate: Three Women of Power in France on the Eve of the Renaissance,4

"Abraham von Worms,S.L. MacGregor Mathers",Paperback,"Around the turn of the century, when ,Aleister Crowley, was working out his system of Magick, the source that he turned to for basics was the system of Abramelin of Egypt. From Abramelin he took his concepts of protections, purifications, evocations, vestments, and dromena down to specific details. This system of Abramelin the Mage is known from a unique 15th century manuscript persevered in the Bibliotheque de l`Arsenal in Paris. In it, Abraham of Wurzburg, a cabalist and connoisseur of magics, describes a tour that he made of the then civilized world, visiting sorcerers, magicians, and cabalists, estimating their powers and virtues. This quest is in itself as fascinating as the similar tours of ,Gurdjieff,. The high point of Abraham`s travels was found in a small town on the banks of the Nile, where he encountered the great magician Abramelin, whose complete system Abraham thereupon sets out in detail. This amounts to a complete course in ceremonial magic (both white and black), which the student can pursue by himself. Abramelin, whose system is based mostly on Hellenistic theurgy of the ,Iamblichan, sort, but with Jewish increments from the Cabala, explains the qualifications needed to become a magician, purifications and asceticisms to be practiced month by month, studies and activities permitted during this period, selections of place and time for working magic, equipment needed, prayers and formulas, evocation of good and evil spirits, commanding spirits, to do one`s will, overcoming rebellious spirits, an similar material. Specific instructions are offered to develop such powers as clairvoyance, divining metals and treasurers, warding off evil magic, healing illness, levitation, transportation, rendering oneself invisible, creating illusions and glamour, reading minds, placing compulsions, working black magic, and a host of other abilities.

"P.M.H. Atwater,Melvin Morse",Hardcover,"""Atwater is earnest, helpful, boldly honest."" --,East West Journal, ,P. M. H. Atwater is unique in this world. As both a near-death survivor and a near-death researcher, she brings a remarkable perspective to her work. Her first book, ,Coming Back to Life, caused a major controversy in the field of near-death studies, and ,Beyond the Light, promises to do the same. ,It presents the most in-depth and comprehensive look at the near-death phenomenon, its after-effects and implications. She challenges the stereotype of the ""amazing grace"" near-death experience of a tunnel of light accompanied by a feeling of well-being. Atwater has provocative evidence of many different types of experiences, including those that are hell-like as well as transcendent. She also discusses and contrasts the experiences of those people who were dead for several days and then revived, those who attempted suicide, and the similarities and differences between near-death experiences and hallucinations. ,Atwater was the first near-death researcher to find that the experience changed the brain's physiology, actually altering its structure. While she was criticized for this bold assertion, subsequent findings have proved her correct. ,Beyond the Light, provocatively probes the ""electrical sensitivity"" that follows near-death episodes as well as the now-acknowledged ""brain-shifts,"" and considers how these findings might change our very notion of mortality. ,Atwater has interviewed hundreds who have experienced near-death and their loved ones and friends. Her conclusions and observations will challenge our assumptions about what we consider life, death, and the existence and evolution of the individual soul. Like almost everyone who has experienced near-death, Atwater has come away spiritually charged with a mission to share her perceptions and sensations. ,Beyond the Light, is about nightmares as well as miracles, joy as well as deep despair. Atwater makes a compelling case that near-death provides us with a fascinating window on one of life's greatest unknowns and sets the stage for our re-examination of what it means to be alive . . . and dead. ,Beyond the Light, also contains a thorough and exhaustively researched resource section for those looking for further reading and guidance to an understanding of this fascinating field of study. ,P. M. H. Atwater experienced three near-death experiences in 1977. She has been exploring this phenomenon ever since.

"Liu Yiming,Thomas Cleary",Paperback,"The ,I Ching ,, or ""Book of Change,"" is considered the oldest of the Chinese classics and has throughout history commanded unsurpassed prestige and popularity. Containing several layers of text and given numerous levels of interpretation, it has captured continuous attention for well over two thousand years. It has been considered a book of fundamental principles by philosophers, politicians, mystics, alchemists, yogins, diviners, sorcerers, and more recently by scientists and mathematicians. ,This first part of the present volume is the text of the ,I Ching , proper—the sixty-four hexagrams plus sayings on the hexagrams and their lines—with the commentary composed by Liu I-ming, a Taoist adept, in 1796. The second part is Liu I-ming's commentary on the two sections added to the ,I Ching , by earlier commentators, believed to be members of the original Confucian school; these two sections are known as the Overall Images and the Mixed Hexagrams. In total, the book illuminates the Taoist inner teachings as practiced in the School of Complete Reality. ,Well versed in Buddhism and Confucianism as well as Taoism, Liu I-ming intended his work to be read as a guide to comprehensive self-realization while living an ordinary life in the world. In his attempt to lift the veil of mystery from the esoteric language of the ,I Ching ,, he employs the terminology of psychology, sociology, history, myth, and religion. This commentary on the ,I Ching , stands as a major contribution to the elucidation of Chinese spiritual genius.","Religion,Taoism,Religion,Philosophy,Occult,Divination,Spirituality,Self Help,Cultural,China,Psychology,Occult,Magick,Classics",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389322560l/1002698.jpg,394743873,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1002698.The_Taoist_I_Ching,338,4.13,13,The Taoist I Ching,300

Bin Ramke,Paperback,"Bin Ramke's poetry has always been concerned with separating the real from the wished-for or the feared. In Matter, Ramke investigates not only the physical realities of our world but the qualities that make things important to us, that give them weight. These poems, often in the voice of a child, are full of yearning and anguish but also an appreciation for the enhanced perceptions and small pleasures to be found among the sadness. All lost things have the same voice, he says, and this universal voice reminds us of home and family and the simple connections of ordinary life - the things that matter. When I was a saint, begins the first poem, I did not have visions but I could see and did note the color of the world.

"Maxwell Richard Bennett,Daniel C. Dennett,John Rogers Searle,P.M.S. Hacker",Hardcover,"In ,Neuroscience and Philosophy, three prominent philosophers and a leading neuroscientist clash over the conceptual presuppositions of cognitive neuroscience. The book begins with an excerpt from Maxwell Bennett and Peter Hacker's ,Philosophical Foundations of Neuroscience, (Blackwell, 2003), which questions the conceptual commitments of cognitive neuroscientists. Their position is then criticized by Daniel Dennett and John Searle, two philosophers who have written extensively on the subject, and Bennett and Hacker in turn respond.,Their impassioned debate encompasses a wide range of central themes: the nature of consciousness, the bearer and location of psychological attributes, the intelligibility of so-called brain maps and representations, the notion of qualia, the coherence of the notion of an intentional stance, and the relationships between mind, brain, and body. Clearly argued and thoroughly engaging, the authors present fundamentally different conceptions of philosophical method, cognitive-neuroscientific explanation, and human nature, and their exchange will appeal to anyone interested in the relation of mind to brain, of psychology to neuroscience, of causal to rational explanation, and of consciousness to self-consciousness.,In his conclusion Daniel Robinson (member of the philosophy faculty at Oxford University and Distinguished Professor Emeritus at Georgetown University) explains why this confrontation is so crucial to the understanding of neuroscientific research. The project of cognitive neuroscience, he asserts, depends on the incorporation of human nature into the framework of science itself. In Robinson's estimation, Dennett and Searle fail to support this undertaking; Bennett and Hacker suggest that the project itself might be based on a conceptual mistake. Exciting and challenging, ,Neuroscience and Philosophy, is an exceptional introduction to the philosophical problems raised by cognitive neuroscience.","Philosophy,Science,Biology,Neuroscience,Psychology,Nonfiction,Writing,Essays,Academic,Humanities,Language,Neuroscience,Brain",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347344811l/100280.jpg,231140444,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100280.Neuroscience_and_Philosophy,215,3.78,18,"Neuroscience and Philosophy: Brain, Mind, and Language",218
Cindy Engel,Hardcover,"This is the first book on a fascinating new field in biology -- zoopharmacognosy, or animal self-medication -- and its lessons for humans. When Rachel Carson published SILENT SPRING, few people knew the meaning of the word ""ecology."" Even fewer people today probably know the meaning of ""zoopharmacognosy."" But that is about to change. In WILD HEALTH, Cindy Engel explores the extraordinary range of ways animals keep themselves healthy, carefully separating scientifically verifiable fact from folklore, hard data from daydreams. As with holistic medicine for humans, there turns out to be more fact in folklore than was previously thought., How do animals keep themselves healthy? They eat plants that have medicinal properties. They select the right foods for a nutritionally balanced diet, often doing a better job of it than humans do. Animals even seek out psychoactive substances -- they get drunk on fermented fruit, hallucinate on mushrooms, become euphoric with opium poppies. They also manipulate their own reproduction with plant chemistry, using some plants as aphrodisiacs and others to enhance fertility. WILD HEALTH includes scores of remarkable examples of the ways animals medicate themselves.,- Desert tortoises will travel miles to mine and eat the calcium needed to keep their shells strong.,- Monkeys, bears, coatis, and other animals rub citrus oils and pungent resins into their coats as insecticides and antiseptics against insect bites.,- Chimpanzees swallow hairy leaves folded in a certain way to purge their digestive tracts of parasites.,- Birds line their nests with plants that protect their chicks from blood-draining mites and lice., In other words, animals try to keep themselves healthy in many of the same ways humans do; in fact, much of early human medicine, including many practices being revived today as ""alternative medicine,"" arose through observations of animals. And, as WILD HEALTH, animals still have a lot to teach us. We could use a little more wild health ourselves.","Health,Nonfiction,Science,Food and Drink,Food,Outdoors,Wilderness,Environment,Nature",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387734654l/1002811.jpg,618071784,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1002811.Wild_Health,288,4.34,8,Wild Health: How Animals Keep Themselves Well and What We Can Learn From Them,70

Michael Ruse,Hardcover,"Creation versus evolution: What seems like a cultural crisis of our day, played out in courtrooms and classrooms across the county, is in fact part of a larger story reaching back through the centuries. The views of both evolutionists and creationists originated as inventions of the Enlightenment - two opposed but closely related responses to a loss of religious faith in the Western world. In his latest book, Michael Ruse, a preeminent authority on Darwinian evolutionary thought and a leading participant in the ongoing debate, uncovers surprising similarities between evolutionist and creationist thinking. Exploring the underlying philosophical commitments of evolutionists, he reveals that those most hostile to religion are just as evangelical as their fundamentalist opponents. But more crucially, and reaching beyond the biblical issues at stake, he demonstrates that these two diametrically opposed ideologies have, since the Enlightenment, engaged in a struggle for the privilege of defining human origins, moral values, and the nature of reality.

Invariably, the source of controversy has been ""design."" Is the appearance of design in organisms (as exhibited in their functional complexity) the result of purely natural forces acting without prevision or teleology? Or, does the appearance of design signify genuine prevision and teleology, and, if so, is that design empirically detectable and thus open to scientific inquiry? Four main positions have emerged in response to these questions: *Darwinism* *self-organization* *theistic evolution* *intelligent design*. The contributors to this volume define their respective positions in an accessible style, inviting readers to draw their own conclusions. Two introductory essays furnish a historical overview of the debate. William A.

Menuge argues that Behe's irreducible complexity is a challenge to reductionism not only in biology, but also in psychology, and shows the inability of the Darwinian psychology proposed by Dawkins, Dennett, and Steven Pinker to explain the integration, unity, direction, and reliability of rational thought. This fascinating defense against scientific materialism is the only book-length study relating Intelligent Design to contemporary issues in the philosophy of mind. Drawing on his experience as both a philosopher and a computer scientist, Menuge deftly shows the reader that the materialist's attempts to rid science of all commitment to teleology can only result in incoherence, and presents instead his own unique argument for the legitimacy of Intelligent Design.","Philosophy,Science,Pseudoscience,Intelligent Design",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348097594l/1002855.jpg,742534049,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1002855.Agents_Under_Fire,264,4.44,0,Agents Under Fire: Materialism and the Rationality of Science,16

Mollie Hunter,Paperback,"About a hundred years ago, they say, a mermaid ruled the cold sea that washed around northern lands. She was beautiful and dangerous, and the fishermen of those parts were careful to speak well of her. All but Eric Anderson, who scorned her very existence—until the day the mermaid smashed his fishing boat against the rocks, nearly killing him and his crew. Eric bid his family good-bye, for after that, no one would sail with him. His grandchildren, Jon and Anna, never stopped missing him; so from the moment they saw the mermaid for themselves, they knew it was up to them to tame her and bring their grandfather home again...","Fantasy,Mythology,Mermaids,Fiction,Childrens,Young Adult,Childrens,Juvenile,Fantasy,Magic",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1180135955l/1002892.jpg,64403440,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1002892.The_Mermaid_Summer,128,3.85,38,The Mermaid Summer,372

Stacy Carlson,Hardcover,"In 1842 Phineas T. Barnum is a young man, freshly arrived in New York and still unknown to the world. With uncanny confidence and impeccable timing, he transforms a dusty natural history museum into a great ark for public imagination. Barnum's museum, with its human wonders and extraordinary live animal menagerie, rises to become not only the nation's most popular attraction, but also a catalyst that ushers America out of a culture of glassed-in exhibits and into the modern age of entertainment.,In this kaleidoscopic setting, the stories of two compelling characters are brought to life. Emile Guillaudeu is the museum's grumpy taxidermist, who is horrified by the chaotic change Barnum brings to his beloved institution. Ana Swift is a professional giantess plagued by chronic pain and jaded by a world of gawkers. The differences between these two are many: one is isolated and spends his working hours making dead things look alive, while the other has people pushing against her, and reacting to her, every day. But they both move toward change, one against his will, propelled by a paradigm shift happening whether he likes it or not, and the other because she is struggling to survive. In many shapes and forms, metamorphosis is at the core of ,Among the Wonderful,. Pursuing this theme, the book weaves a world where upper Manhattan is still untrammeled wilderness, the Five Points is at the height of its bloody glory, and within the walls of Barnum's museum, ancient tribal feuds play out in the midst of an unlikely community of marvels.","Historical,Historical Fiction,Fiction,Historical,Literature,19th Century,Literary Fiction,New York,Museology,Museums,Adult,Adult Fiction,Unfinished",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1357764794l/10029149.jpg,1586421840,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10029149-among-the-wonderful,464,3.4,84,Among the Wonderful,475

Askold Krushelnycky,Paperback,"In December 2004, the world watched as hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians gathered to defy the results of a transparently rigged presidential election. The charismatic popular candidate, Viktor Yushchenko, had been poisoned and disfigured by his opponents. The security forces threatened violent repression. But the demonstrators stayed and, as international pressure grew, the corrupt old regime that had been supported by Putin's Kremlin was deposed. It was the most significant moment for Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall.,An Orange Revolution, is the gripping account of this historic uprising and the events that led to it. Ukraine was treated roughly by the twentieth century, occupied by the Germans and annexed by the Soviets. It saw guerrilla fighting after the Second World War and dissent was crushed by successive Communist administrations. Its history has been one of corruption, power struggles, organised crime, but a resiliently optimistic population.,Based on firsthand observation and interviews with major players and anonymous demonstrators alike, this is about a people who have forced a lasting change: judges who defied death threats, a murdered journalist, amateur musicians who composed an anthem for the people, and soldiers who staked their lives to back the opposition. ,An Orange Revolution ,also traces the story of the author's family, who paid a high price for speaking out. ,An Orange Revolution ,is a captivating book about a defining moment in European history.","Cultural,Ukraine,History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320534108l/1002967.jpg,436206234,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1002967.An_Orange_Revolution,368,3.75,2,An Orange Revolution: A Personal Journey Through Ukrainian History,32
Jigoro Kano,Hardcover,"In 1882 Jigoro Kano (1860-1938) founded Kodokan Judo at Eishoji Temple in Tokyo. It was the culmination of a lifelong devotion to the jujutsu of the past, which he reorganized while taking great care to retain its classical traditions. Historically, martial arts were practiced only by the elite in Japan. Kano, a renowned educator as well as a sportsman, is credited with popularizing the martial arts, and in particular, judo, among people in all levels of society.,When he was young, Kano studied jujutsu, a martial art practiced in Japan since feudal times, which involved throwing, hitting, kicking, stabbing, slashing, choking, bending and twisting limbs-and defenses against these attacks. After years of studying, he realized that although many different jujutsu techniques were taught, there was no one core value holding them together. Kano identified an all-pervasive principle- to make the most efficient use of mental and physical energy-and combined only those techniques in which this principle was correctly applied into modern judo. ""Ju"" means gentleness or giving way. ""Do"" means principle or the way. Judo, therefore is the Way of Gentleness, which implies that first giving way leads to ultimate victory. The Kodokan is literally, ""the school for studying the Way."" This book is a collection of Kano's essential teachings, selected and compiled from his wealth of writings and lectures spanning a period of fifty-one years. Today the International Judo Federation has 187 member countries and regions. As an official sport of the Olympic Games, judo has inspired young people of all nationalities, and Kodokan is universally recognized as the Mecca of Judo.","Combat,Martial Arts,Philosophy,War,Psychology,Nonfiction,Biography",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347256413l/1002968.jpg,4770030150,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1002968.Mind_Over_Muscle,155,4.24,11,Mind Over Muscle: Writings from the Founder of Judo,177

Arthur Kleinman,Paperback,"From the Preface, by Arthur Kleinman:Patients and Healers in the Context of Culture presents a theoretical framework for studying the relationship between medicine, psychiatry, and culture. That framework is principally illustrated by materials gathered in field research in Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, from materials gathered in similar research in Boston. The reader will find this book contains a dialectical tension between two reciprocally related orientations: it is both a cross-cultural (largely anthropological) perspective on the essential components of clinical care and a clinical perspective on anthropological studies of medicine and psychiatry. That dialectic is embodied in my own academic training and professional life, so that this book is a personal statement. I am a psychiatrist trained in anthropology. I have worked in library, field, and clinic on problems concerning medicine and psychiatry in Chinese culture. I teach cross-cultural psychiatry and medical anthropology, but I also practice and teach consultation psychiatry and take a clinical approach to my major cross-cultural teaching and research involvements. The theoretical framework elaborated in this book has been applied to all of those areas; in turn, they are used to illustrate the theory. Both the theory and its application embody the same dialectic. The purpose of this book is to advance both poles of that dialectic: to demonstrate the critical role of social science (especially anthropology and cross-cultural studies) in clinical medicine and psychiatry and to encourage study of clinical problems by anthropologists and other investigators involved in cross-cultural research.","Anthropology,Health,Health Care,Health,Medicine,Psychology,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387715150l/1002980.jpg,520045114,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1002980.Patients_and_Healers_in_the_Context_of_Culture,448,4.24,2,"Patients and Healers in the Context of Culture: An Exploration of the Borderland between Anthropology, Medicine, and Psychiatry",54

But when ravaged bodies show up on the waterfront, an arson covers up human sacrifices, and a powerful business coalition plots to kill the emperor, she feels a tad overwhelmed. ,Worse, Sicarius, the empire's most notorious assassin, is in town.

James J. Lorence,Paperback,"In Georgia during the Great Depression, jobless workers united with the urban poor, sharecroppers, and tenant farmers. In a collective effort that cut across race and class boundaries, they confronted an unresponsive political and social system and helped shape government policies. James J. Lorence adds significantly to our understanding of this movement, which took place far from the northeastern and midwestern sites we commonly associate with Depression-era labor struggles.Drawing on extensive archival research, including newly accessible records of the Communist Party of the United States, Lorence details interactions between various institutional and grassroots players, including organized labor, the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, liberal activists, and officials at every level of government. He shows, for example, how the Communist Party played a more central role than previously understood in the organization of the unemployed and the advancement of labor and working-class interests in Georgia. Communists gained respect among the jobless, especially African Americans, for their willingness to challenge officials, help negotiate the welfare bureaucracy, and gain access to New Deal social programs.,Lorence enhances our understanding of the struggles of the poor and unemployed in a Depression-era southern state. At the same time, we are reminded of their movement's lasting legacy: the shift in popular consciousness that took place as Georgians, ""influenced by a new sense of entitlement fostered by the unemployed organizations,"" began to conceive of new, more-equal relations with the state.","History,Labor",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328808417l/10031346.jpg,820338761,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10031346-the-unemployed-people-s-movement,328,0,0,"The Unemployed People's Movement: Leftists, Liberals, and Labor in Georgia, 1929-1941",0
David S. Barnes,Hardcover,"In this first English-language study of popular and scientific responses to tuberculosis in nineteenth-century France, David Barnes provides a much-needed historical perspective on a disease that is making an alarming comeback in the United States and Europe. Barnes argues that French perceptions of the disease—ranging from the early romantic image of a consumptive woman to the later view of a scourge spread by the poor—owed more to the power structures of nineteenth-century society than to medical science. By 1900, the war against tuberculosis had become a war against the dirty habits of the working class.,Lucid and original, Barnes's study broadens our understanding of how and why societies assign moral meanings to deadly diseases.","History,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348730606l/1003146.jpg,520087720,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1003146.The_Making_of_a_Social_Disease,0,3.67,1,The Making of a Social Disease: Tuberculosis in Nineteenth-Century France,12

Anton Chekhov,,"Chekhov's genius lies in the way he manages to convey with such apparent effortlessness a profound sense of the mystery of beauty, and of the sadness of those who observe and think. The narrator of this apparently inconsequential tale fixes on exactly the right details, from a myriad of possible ones, to strike at the heart. It's a masterpiece of minimalism.,A schoolboy is accompanying his grandfather as they drive in their carriage along a dusty road across the steppe on a sultry August day. They stop for refreshment at the house of an Armenian friend of the grandfather. The boy, the grandfather and their Ukrainian driver are all struck by the beauty of the Armenian's daughter.,Some years later, now a student, the boy is on a train that stops for some minutes at a country station. He gets out to stretch his legs, and sees a girl on the platform talking to someone in one of the carriages. She is very beautiful. ,It's about as spare and empty of plot as a story could be; two impressions that barely even amount to anecdote. Like Waiting for Godot, it's a story in which nothing happens, twice.","Short Stories,Fiction,Cultural,Russia,Literature,Russian Literature,Classics,Literature,Romance,Classics,Classic Literature,Literature,European Literature,Audiobook",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1296237896l/10031990.jpg,,,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10031990-the-beauties,8,3.6,97,The Beauties,460

Benny Green,Paperback,"The Reluctant Art,, first published in 1962 and long out-of-print, stands as one of the most important books on the art of jazz. Comprising five studies—of Bix Beiderbecke, Benny Goodman, Lester Young, Billie Holiday, and Charlie Parker (with the addition of an essay of Art Tatum for this new edition)—Benny Green's humorous, eloquent, and often angry book attempts to point out the gulf between the reality of the jazz musician and his music, on the one hand, and the romantic conceits of early jazz writing and fandom, on the other. Green, himself an excellent early jazz musician, was one of the first jazz writers to bring to the task firsthand knowledge of the music, and this illuminates his understanding of the factors involved in jazz innovation. He discusses jazz in terms of musical and social history, retelling the over-mythologized stories of these great artists with a unique combination of joyous irreverence and acute critical insight, of inspired metaphors and masterly knowledge. Benny Green's classic book swings with the same energy and passion as the timeless music it discusses.",Music,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1266693231l/1003209.jpg,306804417,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1003209.The_Reluctant_Art,210,4,2,The Reluctant Art,9

"Assata Shakur,Angela Y. Davis,Lennox S.

Long a target of J. Edgar Hoover's campaign to defame, infiltrate, and criminalize Black nationalist organizations and their leaders, Shakur was incarcerated for four years prior to her conviction on flimsy evidence in 1977 as an accomplice to murder.,This intensely personal and political autobiography belies the fearsome image of JoAnne Chesimard long projected by the media and the state. With wit and candor, Assata Shakur recounts the experiences that led her to a life of activism and portrays the strengths, weaknesses, and eventual demise of Black and White revolutionary groups at the hand of government officials. The result is a signal contribution to the literature about growing up Black in America that has already taken its place alongside ,The Autobiography of Malcolm X, and the works of Maya Angelou.,Two years after her conviction, Assata Shakur escaped from prison.

The justice department eventually rescinded Bin Wahad's conviction and he was released in 1990, seven months after the documentary premiered.,Mumia Abu-Jamal, a journalist who headed the Black Panther free breakfast program for inner-city school children in Philadelphia, was also accused of the murder of an officer and sent on death-row, where he still is today.,Assata Shakur was a college educated social worker in her twenties when she was accused of shooting a cop, then arrested and tortured and denied medical treatment. Her interview was conducted in Cuba where she has been exiled since her escape from a New Jersey women's prison in 1975.,Bin Wahad, Shakur and Abu-Jamal offer a little-known history and an incisive analysis of the Black Panthers' original goals, which the U.S. Government has tried to distort and suppress.

Frank Thomas,Hardcover,"During the Spanish Civil War two young Welshmen volunteered to fight for their convictions - but on opposite sides. They had similar backgrounds. The elder, Frank Thomas, had a powerful yearning for military adventure. The younger, Sid Hamm, became a Communist before going to Spain. In April 1937, by now a battle-hardened veteran, Thomas was with Franco's Foreign Legion near the town of Brunete, helping to strengthen the Nationalist trenches. Hamm was just arriving in Spain to join the Republican International Brigade. Three months later, Thomas was back home, recuperating from terrible wounds, while Hamm met his death attempting to puncture the very defence works which Thomas had helped to construct. This story of a parochial civil war within the most defining of all civil wars has come to light through Robert Stradling's discovery of two unknown documents.

Merlin Coverley,Hardcover,"Psychogeography. Increasingly this term is used to illustrate a bewildering array of ideas from key lines and the occult, to urban walking and political radicalism. But where does it come from and what exactly does it mean? This book examines the origins of psychogeography in the Situationist Movement of the 1950s, exploring the theoretical background and its political applications as well as the work of early practitioners such as Guy Debord and Raoul Vaneigem. Elsewhere, psychogeographic ideas continue to find retrospective validation in much earlier traditions from the visionary writing of William Blake and Thomas De Quincey to the rise of the flaneur on the streets of 19th century Paris and on through the avant-garde experimentation of the Surrealists. These precursors to psychogeography are discussed here alongside their modern counterparts, for today these ideas hold greater currency than ever through the popularity of writers and filmmakers such as Iain Sinclair and Peter Ackroyd, Stewart Home and Patrick Keiller. From Urban Wandering to Cognitive Mapping, from the Derive to Detournement, psychogeography provides us with new ways of apprehending our surroundings, transforming the familiar streets of our everyday experience into something new and unexpected. This guide conducts the reader through this process, offering both an explanation and definition of the terms involved, and an analysis of the key figures and their work as well as practical information on psychogeographical groups and organizations.","Nonfiction,Philosophy,Psychology,Cities,Urbanism,Philosophy,Theory,Cities,Urban Studies,Art,Politics,Travel,Walking,Sociology",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328695431l/1003489.jpg,1904048617,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1003489.Psychogeography,160,3.35,70,Psychogeography,562

Before writing it, he had been closely allied with phenomenologists such as Husserl and Heidegger. Here, however, Sartre attacked Husserl's notion of a transcendental ego. The break with Husserl, in turn, facilitated Sartre's transition from phenomenology to the existentialist doctrines of his masterwork, ,Being and Nothingness,, which was completed a few years later while the author was a prisoner of war.,This student-friendly edition of ,The Transcendence of the Ego, also includes an introduction and notes/annotations by the translators.","Philosophy,Psychology,Nonfiction,Cultural,France,European Literature,French Literature,Philosophy,Theory,Academic,School,Writing,Essays",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1379150957l/10035.jpg,809015455,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10035.The_Transcendence_of_the_Ego,120,3.82,57,The Transcendence of the Ego: An Existentialist Theory of Consciousness,860

June Thomson,Hardcover,"Exploring the friendship of the inscrutable sleuth Sherlock Holmes and his redoubtable companion, Doctor Watson -- a bond that survived forty-six years -- this scrupulously researched biography constructs the fascinating story of their relationship, for the most part from evidence in the massive canon of Arthur Conan Doyle.

And for anyone who has enjoyed Holmes in print or in film, television, and radio adaptations, it provides a detailed and engaging biographical account of one of literature's great immortal friendships.","Biography,Nonfiction,Mystery,Crime,Mystery,Literature,19th Century,European Literature,British Literature",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1343336359l/1003634.jpg,786708271,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1003634.Holmes_and_Watson,288,3.73,16,Holmes and Watson,107

They are an unlikely pair: Chuck Fipke, a ragged fanatical prospector with a singular talent for finding sand-size mineral grains, and Stew Blusson, an ultra-tough geologist and helicopter pilot.

Margaret Creighton,Paperback,"From the voyage of the Argonauts to the Tailhook scandal, seafaring has long been one of the most glaringly male-dominated occupations. In this groundbreaking interdisciplinary study, Margaret Creighton, Lisa Norling, and their co-authors explore the relationship of gender and seafaring in the Anglo-American age of sail. Drawing on a wide range of American and British sources—from diaries, logbooks, and account ledgers to songs, poetry, fiction, and a range of public sources—the authors show how popular fascination with seafaring and the sailors' rigorous, male-only life led to models of gender behavior based on ""iron men"" aboard ship and ""stoic women"" ashore.,Yet ,Iron Men, Wooden Women, also offers new material that defies conventional views. The authors investigate such topics as women in the American whaling industry and the role of the captain's wife aboard ship. They explore the careers of the female pirates Anne Bonny and Mary Read, as well as those of other women—""transvestite heroines""—who dressed as men to serve on the crews of sailing ships. And they explore the importance of gender and its connection to race for African American and other seamen in both the American and the British merchant marine. Contributors include both social historians and literary critics: Marcus Rediker, Dianne Dugaw, Ruth Wallis Herndon, Haskell Springer, W. Jeffrey Bolster, Laura Tabili, Lillian Nayder, and Melody Graulich, in addition to Margaret Creighton and Lisa Norling.","History,Nonfiction,Adventure,Pirates,Feminism,Historical",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347584809l/1003688.jpg,801851602,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1003688.Iron_Men_Wooden_Women,304,3.83,2,"Iron Men, Wooden Women: Gender and Seafaring in the Atlantic World, 1700-1920",48

Arthur I. Miller,Hardcover,"In August 1930, on a voyage from Madras to London, a young Indian looked up at the stars and contemplated their fate. Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar--Chandra, as he was called--calculated that certain stars would suffer a strange and violent death, collapsing to virtually nothing. This extraordinary claim, the first mathematical description of black holes, brought Chandra into direct conflict with Sir Arthur Eddington, one of the greatest astrophysicists of the day. Eddington ridiculed the young man's idea at a meeting of the Royal Astronomy Society in 1935, sending Chandra into an intellectual and emotional tailspin--and hindering the progress of astrophysics for nearly forty years., Empire of the Stars is the dramatic story of this intellectual debate and its implications for twentieth-century science. Arthur I. Miller traces the idea of black holes from early notions of ""dark stars"" to the modern concepts of wormholes, quantum foam, and baby universes. In the process, he follows the rise of two great theories--relativity and quantum mechanics--that meet head on in black holes. Empire of the Stars provides a unique window into the remarkable quest to understand how stars are born, how they live, and, most portentously (for their fate is ultimately our own), how they die., It is also the moving tale of one man's struggle against the establishment--an episode that sheds light on what science is, how it works, and where it can go wrong. Miller exposes the deep-seated prejudices that plague even the most rational minds. Indeed, it took the nuclear arms race to persuade scientists to revisit Chandra's work from the 1930s, for the core of a hydrogen bomb resembles nothing so much as an exploding star. Only then did physicists realize the relevance, truth, and importance of Chandra's work, which was finally awarded a Nobel Prize in 1983., Set against the waning days of the British Empire and taking us right up to the present, this sweeping history examines the quest to understand one of the most forbidding phenomena in the universe, as well as the passions that fueled that quest over the course of a century.","Science,Nonfiction,Science,Physics,Biography,Science,Astronomy,History,Science,History Of Science",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347568323l/100377.jpg,061834151X,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100377.Empire_of_the_Stars,384,3.77,16,"Empire of the Stars: Obsession, Friendship and Betrayal in the Quest for Black Holes",141

A young woman goes missing, and her mother uproots her life to find her daughter.

Otto Rank,Hardcover,"Originally published in German in 1909, Otto Rank's The Myth of the Birth of the Hero offered psychoanalytical interpretations of mythological stories as a means of understanding the human psyche. Like his mentor Freud, Rank compared the myths of such figures as Oedipus, Moses, and Sargon with common dreams, seeing in both a symbolic fulfillment of repressed desire. Thirteen years later, Rank substantially revised this seminal work, incorporating new discoveries in psychoanalysis, mythology, and ethnology, doubling the size of the book.

Aurel Bejancu,Hardcover,"The theory of foliations of manifolds was created in the forties of the last century by Ch. Ehresmann and G. Reeb [ER44]. Since then, the subject has enjoyed a rapid development and thousands of papers investigating foliations have appeared. A list of papers and preprints on foliations up to 1995 can be found in Tondeur [Ton97]. Due to the great interest of topologists and geometers in this rapidly ev- ving theory, many books on foliations have also been published one after the other. We mention, for example, the books written by: I. Tamura [Tam76], G. Hector and U. Hirsch [HH83], B. Reinhart [Rei83], C. Camacho and A.L. Neto [CN85], H. Kitahara [Kit86], P. Molino [Mol88], Ph. Tondeur [Ton88], [Ton97], V. Rovenskii [Rov98], A. Candel and L. Conlon [CC03]. Also, the survey written by H.B. Lawson, Jr. [Law74] had a great impact on the de- lopment of the theory of foliations. So it is natural to ask: why write yet another book on foliations?

Ariano Suassuna,Paperback,"O romance A história do amor de Fernando e Isaura foi a primeira experiência de Ariano Suassuna no campo da prosa de ficção. Apesar de datar de 1956, permaneceu inédito até 1994, quando foi publica do por uma pequena editora de Recife. Somente agora, meio século depois de escrito, e objeto de uma edição de dimensão nacional através da Editora Jose Olympio. A história do amor de Fernando e Isaura é uma espécie de versão brasileira de Tristão e Isolda (historia imortalizada pela- obra de Joseph Bédier) e, como o próprio autor declarou, lhe serviu para avaliar e exercitar as forças de que dispunha para escrever o grande romance com que vinha sonhando - o clássico ´Romance d´A Pedra do Reino´, escrito entre 1958 e 1970. A história do amor de Fernando e Isaura é uma paixão proibida. Um amor tão verdadeiro e intenso que, impedido de ser vivenciado em toda a sua plenitude, encaminha-se para um trágico desfecho. Até hoje, é o único romance de Suassuna que não se passa na Paraíba e, além disso, ao contrario do que aparece em toda a sua obra, o Sertão encontra-se praticamente ausente da narrativa: seu cenário e Alagoas, com grande parte das ações decorrendo nas proximidades do mar. ""Mais do que simples ´acasos´, o que se percebe por trás dos acontecimentos aqui narrados e o trabalho silencioso do Destino, a tecer sua complexa rede de sortilégios e embustes, preparando armadilhas das quais ninguém se encontra a salvo"",escreve_Carlos Newton Junior na apresentação. ""Suassuna usa todo seu talento de escritor para delegar ao Destino um papel decisivo no desenrolar da história, criando uma atmosfera de tragédia grega que não existe no romance de Bédier e que atribui, a Fernando e Isaura, a originalidade necessária a toda e qualquer obra de arte.""","Literature,Fiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1293485499l/10039171.jpg,8503007959,9790000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10039171-a-hist-ria-do-amor-de-fernando-e-isaura,174,3.77,7,A história do amor de Fernando e Isaura,115
Douglas  Hunter,Hardcover,"Skilled, determined, tireless, and courageous, Steve Yzerman may be the most revered player in the NHL today. Drawing on the insights of coaches, teammates and league insiders, award-winning writer Douglas Hunter charts Yzerman's career as ""the player's player,"" the embodiment of skill, dedication, sacrifice, and leadership.,Yzerman went fourth overall to the Detroit Red Wings in the very strong 1983 NHL entry draft, which included such prospects as Tom Barasso, Cam Neely, and Pat LaFontaine. He made an immediate impact in the NHL with his dazzling offensive skills. In 1986, having just turned 21, he was made the youngest captain in league history.,Despite his individual success, including being one of the only three players in NHL history to record a 155-point season, Yzerman's team struggled and Detroit's devoted hockey fans wondered when he would reverse the Red Wings' fortunes. When Detroit was unexpectedly bumped from the playoffs in the '95 Stanley Cup final, many fingers, pointed at the captain. Determined to bring a championship back to Detroit, shrugging off persistent trade rumors, Yzerman continued to adjust his game for the good of the team. While his finesse as a playmaker and goal scorer remained in evidence, the gritty centerman blocked shots, drove to the net, and worked tirelessly along the boards in the corners. He led by aggressive example on the ice and with quiet confidence in the dressing room.,In 1997, when the Red Wings won their first Stanley Cup since 1955, Yzerman proved he was a winner. He proved it again the next season, when he raised the Cup for a second time and was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoffs' most valuable player.

Rather than predicting a set future, Vedic palmistry shows us how to take active steps to influence and improve our destinies once we have gained better self-understanding. Using dozens of illustrations and examples of actual palm prints, Birla demonstrates how our less dominant hand reflects all that we have inherited from the past--old behavior patterns, thoughts, desires, and attitudes--while our dominant hand (the hand we write with) reflects our resolve to change for the better. By comparing both hands we gain an understanding of where we are coming from and where we are headed.

Tomoko Masuzawa,Paperback,"The idea of ""world religions"" expresses a vague commitment to multiculturalism. Not merely a descriptive concept, ""world religions"" is actually a particular ethos, a pluralist ideology, a logic of classification, and a form of knowledge that has shaped the study of religion and infiltrated ordinary language.,In this ambitious study, Tomoko Masuzawa examines the emergence of ""world religions"" in modern European thought. Devoting particular attention to the relation between the comparative study of language and the nascent science of religion, she demonstrates how new classifications of language and race caused Buddhism and Islam to gain special significance, as these religions came to be seen in opposing terms-Aryan on one hand and Semitic on the other. Masuzawa also explores the complex relation of ""world religions"" to Protestant theology, from the hierarchical ordering of religions typical of the Christian supremacists of the nineteenth century to the aspirations of early twentieth-century theologian Ernst Troeltsch, who embraced the pluralist logic of ""world religions"" and by so doing sought to reclaim the universalist destiny of European modernity.","Religion,History,Philosophy,Theory,Philosophy,Nonfiction,Academic,Spirituality,Religion,Theology,Anthropology,Academic,School",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328873871l/1004046.jpg,226509893,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1004046.The_Invention_of_World_Religions,359,4.04,16,"The Invention of World Religions: Or, How European Universalism Was Preserved in the Language of Pluralism",150

Sten Nadolny,Paperback,""",Die Entdeckung der Langsamkeit,"" ist auf den ersten Blick zugleich ein Seefahrerroman, ein Roman über das Abenteuer und die Sehnsucht danach und ein Entwicklungsroman. Doch hat Sten Nadolny die Biographie des englischen Seefahrers und Nordpolforschers John Franklin (1786-1847) zu einer subtilen Studie über die Zeit umgeschrieben: die Langsamkeit als eine Kunst, dem Rhythmus des Lebens Sinn zu verleihen. Wie bei einem Palimpsest erscheint hinter den Sätzen eine andere Schrift, hinter der Prägnanz und Redlichkeit der Aufklärung verbergen sich Humor und Traurigkeit der Romantik.,Von Kindheit an träumt John Franklin davon, zur See zu fahren, obwohl er dafür denkbar ungeeignet ist: Langsam im Sprechen und Denken, langsam in seinen Reaktionen mißt er die Zeit nach eigenen Maßstäben. Zunächst erkennt nur sein Lehrer, daß Johns eigenartige Behinderung auch Vorzüge hat - was er einmal erfaßt hat, das behält er, das Einzigartige, das Detail begreift er besser als andere. John Franklin geht zur Marine, erlebt den Krieg und das Sterben. Beides trifft ihn um so furchtbarer, als er innerhalb des von ihm kaum begriffenen, chaotisch schnellen Geschehens einzelne Vorgänge wie in Zeitlupe ablaufen sieht.

Joseph Nigg,Hardcover,"Dragons, unicorns, griffins, and sea monsters are only some of the many fantastic animals that continue to enthrall people, even though such creatures exist only in our imaginations. As such, they have animated human folklore for thousands of years, serving as metaphors for our fears, hopes, dreams, and struggles. Here is a modern collection of lore that reflects many different cultures as it focuses on a panoply of fantastic animals. From ancient Greece came the griffin, a combination eagle and lion who guarded a treasure of gold, and whose feathers gave sight to the blind. From Egypt came the mysterious Sphinx, half human and half lion, and from Persia came Karkadan, a large, ferocious, one-horned monster who could be captured and subdued only by a young maiden. Not all mythical beasts are fierce. Lung and other Chinese dragons are cheerful and benevolent, and Drakon was reputed to be a loyal guard of the Greeks' sacred springs and treasures. This profusely illustrated book tells stories of winged birds, scaled serpents, and legendary sea creatures. It also features a unique family tree of legendary bestial correspondences that traces dragon relationships from one culture's folklore to another.

"Christine Alexander,Mason Kunze",Kindle Edition,"This book presents the remarkable personal journals of a German soldier who participated in Operation Barbarossa and subsequent battles on the Eastern Front, revealing the combat experience of the German-Russian War as seldom seen before.,Hans Roth was a member of the anti-tank (Panzerjager) battalion, 299th Infantry Division, attached to Sixth Army, as the invasion of Russia began. Writing as events transpired, he recorded the mystery and tension as the Germans deployed on the Soviet frontier in June 1941. Then a firestorm broke loose as the Wehrmacht tore across the front, forging into the primitive vastness of the East. ,During the Kiev encirclement, Roth's unit was under constant attack as the Soviets desperately tried to break through the German ring. At one point, after the enemy had finally been beaten, a friend serving with the SS led him to a site where he witnessed civilians being massacred en masse (which may well have been Babi Yar). After suffering through a horrible winter against apparently endless Russian reserves, his division went on the offensive again, this time on the northern wing of ""Case Gelb,"" the German drive toward Stalingrad.,In these journals, attacks and counterattacks are described in ""you are there"" detail, as Roth wrote privately, as if to keep himself sane, knowing that his honest accounts of the horrors in the East could never pass through Wehrmacht censors. When the Soviet counteroffensive of winter 1942 begins, his unit is stationed alongside the Italian 8th Army, and his observations of its collapse, as opposed to the reaction of the German troops sent to stiffen its front, are of special fascination.,Roth’s three journals were discovered many years after his disappearance, tucked away in the home of his brother, with whom he was known to have had a deep bond. After his brother’s death, his family discovered them and quickly sent them to Rosel, Roth’s wife. In time, Rosel handed down the journals to Erika, Roth’s only daughter, who had meantime immigrated to America.,Hans Roth was doubtlessly working on a fourth journal before he was reported missing in action in July 1944 during the battle known as the Destruction of Army Group Center. Although Roth’s ultimate fate remains unknown, what he did leave behind, now finally revealed, is an incredible firsthand account of the horrific war the Germans waged in Russia.","History,Nonfiction,War,World War II,Military,Military History,War,Military Fiction,War,Cultural,Russia,Biography,Autobiography,Memoir,European Literature,German Literature",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328301229l/10041133.jpg,,,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10041133-eastern-inferno,241,4.12,43,"Eastern Inferno: The Journals of a German Panzerjager on the Eastern Front, 1941-43",819

Now, the war is over but victory's wine has soured and Brodie's back in Scotland to try and save childhood friend Hugh Donovan from the gallows. Everyone thought Donovan was dead, shot down in the war. Perhaps it would have been kinder if he had been killed. The man who returned was unrecognizable: mutilated, horribly burned.

Being fat is seen as much more than a physical condition. Fat women are stereotypically viewed as unfeminine, either in flight from sexuality or sexual in some forbidden way, intentionally antisocial, out of control, hostile, aggressive.,Using case studies, moving, sometimes painful, autobiographical accounts, and observing such organizations as a fat rights society, Overeaters Anonymous, and a children's diet camp, Marcia Millman reveals how people live with the burden of these stereotypes and explores the truth or falsity of them.,This book proves the humanness, the defiance, vulnerability, self-doubt, courage, and even the beauty of those who violate our arbitrary standards of physical beauty.

Her former friends no longer dare to look at her, much less speak to her. All that she has left are her mother and her beloved, misshapen brother Asterion, who must be held captive below the palace for his own safety., So when a ship arrives one spring day, bearing a tribute of slaves from Athens, Ariadne sneaks out to meet it. These newcomers don’t know the ways of Krete; perhaps they won’t be afraid of a girl who will someday be a powerful goddess. And indeed she meets Theseus, the son of the king of Athens. Ariadne finds herself drawn to the newcomer, and soon they form a friendship—one that could perhaps become something more., Yet Theseus is doomed to die as an offering to the Minotaur, that monster beneath the palace—unless he can kill the beast first.

Sara  Seager,ebook,"Over the past twenty years, astronomers have identified hundreds of extrasolar planets--planets orbiting stars other than the sun. Recent research in this burgeoning field has made it possible to observe and measure the atmospheres of these exoplanets. This is the first textbook to describe the basic physical processes--including radiative transfer, molecular absorption, and chemical processes--common to all planetary atmospheres, as well as the transit, eclipse, and thermal phase variation observations that are unique to exoplanets., In each chapter, Sara Seager offers a conceptual introduction, examples that combine the relevant physics equations with real data, and exercises. Topics range from foundational knowledge, such as the origin of atmospheric composition and planetary spectra, to more advanced concepts, such as solutions to the radiative transfer equation, polarization, and molecular and condensate opacities. Since planets vary widely in their atmospheric properties, Seager emphasizes the major physical processes that govern all planetary atmospheres., Moving from first principles to cutting-edge research, ,Exoplanet Atmospheres, is an ideal resource for students and researchers in astronomy and earth sciences, one that will help prepare them for the next generation of planetary science., The first textbook to describe exoplanet atmospheres, Illustrates concepts using examples grounded in real data, Provides a step-by-step guide to understanding the structure and emergent spectrum of a planetary atmosphere, Includes exercises for students",Textbooks,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356036014l/10045438.jpg,1400835305,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10045438-exoplanet-atmospheres,264,3.78,1,Exoplanet Atmospheres: Physical Processes,9

"Sam Kashner,Nancy Schoenberger",Paperback,"Oscar Levant was the Amadeus of Hollywood, the Oscar Wilde of Broadway -- and the most wildly self-destructive personality ever to become a household name. An astonishingly gifted concert pianist, composer, film and stage presence, radio and television raconteur, insult wit, and bestselling author, Levant steered a maniacally masochistic course through seven glorious decades. His death in 1972, at the age of 65, left the entertainment community shocked -- largely with amazement that a four-pack-a-day smoker with a history of drug abuse and mental illness had lasted as long as Levant did. He made a national reputation for himself in the late '30s as a brash, brilliant 'expert' on radio's famed quiz show 'Information, Please!', and as a fine concert pianist and the premier interpreter of George Gershwin's concert works. He appeared in 13 films, usually as a best friend/'Oscar Levant' type. He played Gene Kelly's sidekick in 'An American in Paris' and a lovable hypochondriac in 'The Band Wagon, ' and in the film biography 'Rhapsody in Blue, ' he literally played himself: Oscar Levant, best friend to George Gershwin, a role he knew all too well. His hero worship of Gershwin stunted his confidence as a songwriter and a serious composer, though one of his pop songs, 'Blame It on My Youth, ' has become a standard, and Arnold Schoenberg, Aaron Copeland, and Virgil Thomson all thought Levant an immensely gifted composer. Levant's addiction to Demerol following a heart attack in the early '50s led to nearly a decade of drug dependency. Already hobbled by complex superstitions meant to ward off the terrors of performing, Levant was almost destroyed by his addictions. But his intense neurosisdidn't keep him from appearing on television to talk about it. His uncensored comments on 'The Jack Paar Show' and on his own local Los Angeles talk show made national news.

Germano Celant,Hardcover,"A groundbreaking work, edited by Germano Celant in collaboration with the artist and her New York studio, which enriches our knowledge of Louise Bourgeois. Over a long career she worked through most of the twentieth century's avant-garde artistic movements from abstraction to realism, yet always remained uniquely individual, powerfully inventive, and often at the forefront of contemporary art. She was one of the world’s most respected sculptors, best known for her public-space pieces, grand-scale sculptures of spiders so large they must rest outside. But beginning in the 1960s, she used her own clothing and that of her loved ones as components of her sculptures and designs: a reincarnation of her childhood and her past. Her art would expand into new realms in 2002 when she began to weave together scraps of iridescent-colored fabric, creating works that vary from figures of flowers to chromatic abstractions, constituting a repertoire of truly surprising interweaves.

Cross-Cultural Consumption is a fascinating guide to the cultural implications of the globalization of a consumer society. The chapters address topics ranging from the clothing of colonial subjects in South Africa and the rise of the hypermarket in Argentina, to the presentation of culture in international tourist hotels. Through their examination of cultural imperialism and cultural appropriation of the representation of otherness and identity, Howes and his contributors show how the increasingly global flow of goods and images challenges the very idea of the cultural border and creates new spaces for cultural invention.

Jason K. Stearns,Hardcover,"At the heart of Africa is Congo, a country the size of Western Europe, bordering nine other nations, that since 1996 has been wracked by a brutal and unstaunchable war in which millions have died. And yet, despite its epic proportions, it has received little sustained media attention. In this deeply reported book, Jason Stearns vividly tells the story of this misunderstood conflict through the experiences of those who engineered and perpetrated it. He depicts village pastors who survived massacres, the child soldier assassin of President Kabila, a female Hutu activist who relives the hunting and methodical extermination of fellow refugees, and key architects of the war that became as great a disaster as--and was a direct consequence of--the genocide in neighboring Rwanda. Through their stories, he tries to understand why such mass violence made sense, and why stability has been so elusive.,Through their voices, and an astonishing wealth of knowledge and research, Stearns chronicles the political, social, and moral decay of the Congolese State.","History,Cultural,Africa,Nonfiction,War,Politics,Eastern Africa,Rwanda,War,Military Fiction,History,World History,Political Science,International Relations,Military,Military History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328757755l/10046142.jpg,1586489291,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10046142-dancing-in-the-glory-of-monsters,400,4.16,317,Dancing in the Glory of Monsters: The Collapse of the Congo and the Great War of Africa,4064

The long deconstructionist era was followed with a period dominated by Deleuze, which has in turn evolved into a new situation still difficult to define. However, one common thread running through the new brand of continental positions is a renewed attention to materialist and realist options in philosophy. Among the leaders of the established generation, this new focus takes numerous forms. It might be hard to find many shared positions in the writings of Badiou, DeLanda, Laruelle, Latour, Stengers, and i ek, but what is missing from their positions is an obsession with the critique of written texts. All of them elaborate a positive ontology, despite the incompatibility of their results. Meanwhile, the new generation of continental thinkers is pushing these trends still further, as seen in currents ranging from transcendental materialism to the London-based speculative realism movement to new revivals of Derrida. As indicated by the title The Speculative Turn, the new currents of continental philosophy depart from the text-centered hermeneutic models of the past and engage in daring speculations about the nature of reality itself. This anthology assembles authors, of several generations and numerous nationalities, who will be at the centre of debate in continental philosophy for decades to come.","Philosophy,Philosophy,Theory,Nonfiction,Philosophy,Metaphysics",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1293502184l/10047209.jpg,9780980668,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10047209-the-speculative-turn,430,3.74,8,The Speculative Turn: Continental Materialism and Realism,117

Miguel Amorós,Paperback,"«La historia de nuestra guerra civil está llena de cuestiones cuya resolución objetiva es una necesidad para aquellos que luchan contra la destrucción del conocimiento histórico emprendido desde el poder, porque la liquidación de la memoria histórica asociada al proletariado significaría la eliminación de toda perspectiva revolucionaria. La figura de Durruti, en tanto que personificación de la revolución proletaria anarquista de 1936 concentró muchas de esas cuestiones, verdaderas heridas del movimiento libertario, que en su propio beneficio conviene mantener abiertas y hurgar en ellas. Si duelen, es signo de que sus ideas perviven. Esas ideas no tienen precio. Quienes trataron de venderlas, se vendieron sólo a sí mismos. El anarquismo o es radical o no es nada. Sin embargo en los tiempos del espectáculo y la cultura de masas el pasado vendría ser una mercancía moderna, consumible como cualquier otra. Un objeto cultural de entretenimiento asequible en cuadernos coleccionables, DVDs o series televisivas. La banda de historiadores de la universidad ya no tiene por función la falsificación o la ocultación del pasado como hacían los estalinistas sino su conversión en espectáculo. El primer paso de esa preparación para el consumo ha sido la museificación. La historia para la pandilla universitaria sería un enorme panteón de cadáveres a los que se podría despedazar y analizar como se haría con las momias de Egipto. La distancia que nos separa de ellos sería tan fabulosa que nada habría que temer. El punto de vista forense certificaría el lejano momento de la defunción y desplegaría un abanico de hipótesis a escoger. Ese aspecto ""plural"" es el marchamo de la mercancía ; en el espectáculo importa poco la moraleja. Se trabaja para el olvido pero de otra manera : si los historiadores estalinistas se servían del presente para reescribir el pasado, los actuales expertos de niversidad se sirven del pasado para mistificar el presente. La historia-espectáculo legitima la dominación como si ésta no tuviera que ver con aquél ; embalsamando cadáveres, el poder quiere mostrarse como el heredero legal de los vencidos y no como el vencedor de la víspera. Como buen usurpador, quiere que no se sepa que es un recién llegado, que su pasado es reciente, que prácticamente no tiene historia. Que está ahí porque nadie se decide a echarlo. Un buen ejemplo ha sido el ""socialismo libertario"" que hace unos años sacó de la chistera el presidente Zapatero. La mercantilización espectacular de la guerra civil correspondería a una pérdida total del sentido histórico en las masas, vacías y atemorizadas. No obstante dicha pérdida no es completa y por lo tanto, tiene remedio. Todavía la historia no es de quien la manipula. Durruti no ha muerto.»","Civil War,Spanish Civil War",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1293508812l/10047799.jpg,8496044734,9790000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10047799-durruti-en-el-laberinto,120,4.42,1,Durruti en el laberinto,12

"Johanna Sinisalo,Herbert Lomas",Paperback,"Everyone has their rough nights, but things have clearly taken a turn for the surreal when Angel, a young photographer, finds a group of drunken teenagers in the courtyard of his apartment building, taunting a young troll. Trolls are known in Scandinavian mythology as wild beasts like the werewolf, but this troll is just a small, wounded creature. Angel decides to offer it a safe haven for the night. In the morning Angel thinks he dreamed it all. But he finds the troll alive, well, and drinking from his toilet. What does one do with a troll in the city?,Angel begins researching frantically. Angel searches the Internet, folklore, nature journals, and newspaper clippings, but his research doesn't tell him that trolls exude pheromones that have a profound aphrodisiac effect on all those around him. As Angel's life changes beyond recognition, it becomes clear that the troll is familiar with the man's most forbidden feelings, and that it may take him across lines he never thought he'd cross. A novel of sparkling originality, Troll is a wry, peculiar, and beguiling story of nature and man's relationship to wild things, and of the dark power of the wildness in ourselves.","Fantasy,Fiction,European Literature,Finnish Literature,LGBT,Fantasy,Urban Fantasy,GLBT,Queer,Contemporary,Romance,Magical Realism,Novels",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328822266l/100485.jpg,802141293,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100485.Troll,278,3.58,460,Troll: A Love Story,4354

Patrik S. Schumacher,Hardcover,"Take a theoretical approach to architecture with ,The Autopoiesis of Architecture,, which presents the topic as a discipline with its own unique logic. Architecture's conception of itself is addressed as well as its development within wider contemporary society. Author Patrik Schumacher offers innovative treatment that enriches architectural theory with a coordinated arsenal of concepts facilitating both detailed analysis and insightful comparisons with other domains, such as art, science and politics. He explores how the various modes of communication comprising architecture depend upon each other, combine, and form a unique subsystem of society that co-evolves with other important autopoietic subsystems like art, science, politics and the economy.,The first of two volumes that together present a comprehensive account of architecture's autopoiesis, this book elaborates the theory of architecture's autopoeisis in 8 parts, 50 sections and 200 chapters. Each of the 50 sections poses a thesis drawing a central message from the insights articulated within the respective section. The 200 chapters are gathering and sorting the accumulated intelligence of the discipline according to the new conceptual framework adopted, in order to catalyze and elaborate the new formulations and insights that are then encapsulated in the theses. However, while the theoretical work in the text of the chapters relies on the rigorous build up of a new theoretical language, the theses are written in ordinary language ? with the theoretical concepts placed in brackets. The full list of the 50 theses affords a convenient summary printed as appendix at the end of the book.,The second volume completes the analysis of the discourse and further proposes a new agenda for contemporary architecture in response to the challenges and opportunities that confront architectural design within the context of current societal and technological developments.",Architecture,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1302156014l/10048929.jpg,470772999,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10048929-the-autopoiesis-of-architecture-volume-i,478,2.71,1,"The Autopoiesis of Architecture, Volume I: A New Framework for Architecture",7

Susan Starr Sered,Paperback,"Religion is often denounced as one of the tools used by patriarchal societies to maintain the status quo, and especially to persuade women to accept subordinate roles. This does not explain, however, the existence of many religious groups in which women are both leaders and the majority of participants. How are these women's religions different from those dominated by men? What can we learn from them about the special ways in which women experience their unique reality? In this fascinating and pathbreaking work--the first comparative study of women's religions--Susan Starr Sered seeks answers to these compelling questions., Looking for common threads linking groups as diverse as the ancestral cults of the Black Caribs of Belize, Korean shamanism, Christian Science, and the Feminist Spirituality movement, Sered finds that motherhood and motherly concerns play a vital role in these female-dominated groups. Nurturing and concern for others are at the center, as are healing arts and ways of dealing with illness and the death of children. Religion not only enables women to find sacred meaning in their daily lives, from the preparation of food to caring for their families, but an offer intense and personal relationships with deities and spirits--often through ecstatic possession trance--as well as opportunities to celebrate and mourn with other women., By examining the shared experiences of women across great cultural divides, ,Priestess, Mother, Sacred Sister, offers a new understanding of the role gender plays in determining how individuals grapple with the ultimate questions of existence. In the process, it not only highlights the profound differences between men and women, but the equally important ways in which we are all alike.","Religion,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348231362l/1005031.jpg,195104676,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1005031.Priestess_Mother_Sacred_Sister,352,3.73,6,"Priestess, Mother, Sacred Sister: Religions Dominated by Women",22

Marianne E. Kalinke,Hardcover,"In ,The Arthur of the North,, Marianne E. Kalinke offers the first book-length study of the Arthurian literature translated from French and Latin into Old Norse-Icelandic in the thirteenth century.  Preserved mostly in Icelandic manuscripts, in early modern times these Scandinavian Arthurian legends inspired the composition of narrative poems and chapbooks in Denmark, Iceland, and Norway, chiefly of the Tristan legend. The importation of Arthurian literature in the North, primarily French romances and lais, is indebted largely to the efforts of King Hákon Hákonarson (r. 1217–63) of Norway, who commissioned the translation of Thomas de Bretagne’s ,Tristan ,in 1226, and subsequently several Arthurian romances by Chrétien de Troyes and a number of Breton lais.

Jim Igoe,Paperback,"CONSERVATION AND GLOBALIZATION opens with a discussion of these two broad issues as they relate to the author's fieldwork with Maasai herding communities on the margins of Tarangire National Park in Tanzania. It explores different theoretical perspectives (Neo-Marxist and Foucauldian) on globalization and why both are relevant to the case studies presented. Readers are introduced to the practice of multi-sited ethnography and its centrality to the anthropological study of globalization. While drawing on examples from specific Maasai communities, the book is more broadly concerned with the historical and contemporary links between these communities and a global system of institutions, ideas, and money. The ecological incompatibility of Western national park-style conservation with East African savanna ecosystems and Maasai resource management practices, are highlighted. The concept of national parks is traced temporally and geographically from Maasai communities to the enclosure movement in 18th century England and westward expansion in 19th century North America. The relationships of parks to Judeo-Christian assumptions about ""man's place in nature,"" colonial ideologies like Manifest Destiny and the Civilizing Mission, and capitalist notions of private property and ""The Tragedy of the Commons,"" are explored. The book also looks at the latest conservation paradigm of ""Community-Based Conservation,"" and explores its connections to the Soviet Collapse, economic and political liberalization, and the global proliferation of NGOs.","Nonfiction,Anthropology",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347899633l/1005204.jpg,534613179,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1005204.Conservation_and_Globalization,200,3.79,3,Conservation and Globalization: A Study of National Parks and Indigenous Communities from East Africa to South Dakota,42

Alcida Rita Ramos,Paperback,"Indigenous people comprise only 0.2% of Brazil's population, yet occupy a prominent role in the nation's consciousness. In her important and passionate new book, anthropologist Alcida Ramos explains this irony, exploring Indian and non-Indian attitudes about interethnic relations. Ramos contends that imagery about indigenous people reflects an ambivalence Brazil has about itself as a nation, for Indians reveal Brazilians’ contradiction between their pride in ethnic pluralism and desire for national homogeneity.,    Based on her more than thirty years of fieldwork and activism on behalf of the Yanomami Indians, Ramos explains the complex ideology called indigenism. She evaluates its meaning through the relations of Brazilian Indians with religious and lay institutions, non-governmental organizations, official agencies such as the National Indian Foundation as well as the very discipline of anthropology. Ramos not only examines the imagery created by Brazilians of European descent—members of the Catholic church, government officials, the army and the state agency for Indian affairs—she also scrutinizes Indians' own self portrayals used in defending their ethnic rights against the Brazilian state. ,    Ramos’ thoughtful and complete analysis of the relation between indigenous people of Brazil and the state will be of great interest to lawmakers and political theorists, environmental and civil rights activists, developmental specialists and policymakers, and those concerned with human rights in Latin America.","Cultural,Brazil",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328828841l/1005276.jpg,299160440,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1005276.Indigenism,368,3.63,1,Indigenism: Ethnic Politics In Brazil,8

"David Shultz,David Wieck",Hardcover,"So much has been written about Gettysburg, goes the well-worn cliche, that there is nothing new left to write. ,The Second Day at Gettysburg: The Attack and Defense of Cemetery Ridge, July 2, 1863,, by David L. Shultz and Scott L. Mingus Sr. aptly demonstrates that there is indeed still much to learn about the war's largest and bloodiest battle.,Based upon a faulty early-morning reconnaissance, General Robert E. Lee decided to attack up the Emmitsburg Road in an effort to collapse the left flank of General George Meade's Army of the Potomac and decisively defeat it. The effort got underway when General James Longstreet's First Corps troops crushed General Sickles' Peach Orchard salient and turned north and east to drive deeply into the Union rear. A third Confederate division under Richard Anderson, part of A. P. Hill's Third Corps, joined in the attack, slamming one brigade after another into the overstretched Union line stitched northward along the Emmitsburg Road. The bloody fighting stair-stepped its way up Cemetery Ridge, tearing open a large gap in the center of the Federal line that threatened to split the Union army in two. The fate of the Battle of Gettysburg hung in the balance.,Despite the importance of the position, surprisingly few Union troops were available to defend the yawning gap on the ridge. Major General Winfield S. Hancock's Second Corps had been reduced to less than one division when his other two were sucked southward to reinforce the collapsing Third Corps front. Reprising Horatio at the Bridge, the gallant commander cobbled together a wide variety of infantry and artillery commands and threw them into the action, refusing to yield even one acre of ground. The long and intense fighting included hand-to-hand combat and the personal heroics of which legends are made.,Veteran Gettysburg authors Shultz and Mingus merge their subject matter expertise and keen understanding of the complex undulating terrain and physical features to produce the most detailed study of this action ever written. In addition to demonstrating how the fighting on the far Union left directly affected the combat to come in the center of General Meade's line, the authors also address some of the most commonly overlooked aspects of the fighting: what routes did some of the key units take to reach the front? What could the commanders actually see, and when could they see it? How did the fences, roads, farms, trees, ravines, creeks, and others obstacles directly affect tactical decisions, and ultimately the battle itself? ,Based upon extensive research and graced with dozens of photographs and detailed original maps, The Second Day at Gettysburg offers a balanced, compelling, and ultimately satisfying account of one of the most overlooked and yet important aspects of the defining battle of the American Civil War.","Military History,Civil War,American Civil War,Civil War Eastern Theater,American History,American Civil War",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1445791914l/10053258.jpg,1611210747,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10053258-the-second-day-at-gettysburg,550,4.44,6,"The Second Day at Gettysburg: The Attack and Defense of Cemetery Ridge, July 2, 1863",41

Drawing from extensive archival sources, and from personal interviews and communications with Bock and Harnick themselves and their most important collaborators, author Philip Lambert explores the essence of a Bock-Harnick show-how it is put together, and what makes it work. The book includes discussion of songs such as Sunrise, Sunset and If I Were a Rich Man that have long been favorites in the public consciousness, and it also explores a vast catalogue of lesser-known songs from their many other shows and works, including a musical puppet show on Broadway, music for the 1964 World's Fair, and a made-for-television musical.

"Oecumenius,Andrew of Caesarea",Hardcover,"The Eastern church gives little evidence of particular interest in the book of Revelation. Oecumenius of Isauria's commentary on the book is the earliest full treatment in Greek and dates only from the early sixth century. Along with Oecumenius's commentary, only that of Andrew of Caesarea (dating from the same era and often summarizing Oecumenius before offering a contrary opinion) and that of Arethas of Caesarea four centuries later provide any significant commentary from within the Greek tradition. William Weinrich renders a particular service to readers interested in ancient commentary on the Apocalypse by translating in one volume the two early sixth-century commentaries. Because of the two interpreters' often differing understandings, readers are exposed not only to early dialogue on the meaning and significance of the book for the faith and life of the church, but also to breadth of interpretation within the unity of the faith the two shared.","Christianity,New Testament",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348968185l/10054658.jpg,830829083,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10054658-greek-commentaries-on-revelation,212,4.5,3,Greek Commentaries on Revelation,6

Dorothy Roberts,Hardcover,"A decade after the Human Genome Project proved that human beings are not naturally divided by race, the emerging fields of personalized medicine, reproductive technologies, genetic genealogy, and DNA databanks are attempting to resuscitate race as a biological category written in our genes. In this provocative analysis, leading legal scholar and social critic Dorothy Roberts argues that America is once again at the brink of a virulent outbreak of classifying population by race. By searching for differences at the molecular level, a new race-based science is obscuring racism in our society and legitimizing state brutality against communities of color at a time when America claims to be post-racial.,Moving from an account of the evolution of race—proving that it has always been a mutable and socially defined political division supported by mainstream science—Roberts delves deep into the current debates, interrogating the newest science and biotechnology, interviewing its researchers, and exposing the political consequences obscured by the focus on genetic difference. ,Fatal Invention, is a provocative call for us to affirm our common humanity.","Nonfiction,Race,Science,Race,Anti Racist,Politics,Social Movements,Social Justice,History,Sociology,Health,Medicine,Economics",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328751704l/10055524.jpg,1595584951,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10055524-fatal-invention,400,4.34,132,"Fatal Invention: How Science, Politics, and Big Business Re-create Race in the Twenty-First Century",1039
John W. Dower,Hardcover,"Remembering and reconstructing the past inevitably involves forgetting—and nowhere more so than in the complex relationship between the United States and Japan since the end of World War II. In this provocative and probing series of essays, John W. Dower—one of our leading historians of postwar Japan and author of the Pulitzer Prize–winning ,Embracing Defeat,—explores the uses and abuses to which this history has been subjected and, with deliberation and insight, affirms the urgent need for scholars to ask the questions that are not being asked.,Taking as a starting point the work of E.H. Norman, the unjustly neglected historian of prewar Japan, ,Ways of Forgetting, Ways of Remembering, sets out both to challenge historiographical orthodoxy and reveal the configurations of power inherent in scholarly and popular discourse in Japan and America. Dower’s fascination with capturing popular experience leads to sources as far ranging as textiles adorned with wartime propaganda and the satirical cartoon panels that decorate traditional karuta playing cards. Dower, who is rightly known as one of the most perceptive critics of American foreign policy, also offers a blistering critique of the U.S. occupation of Iraq and the misuse of postwar Japan as an example of success.,Ways of Forgetting, Ways of Remembering, is a profound look at American and Japanese perceptions—past and present—of key moments in their shared history. An incisive investigation of the problems of public history and its role in a modern democracy, these essays are essential reading for anyone interested in postwar U.S.-Japan relations, as well as the broader discipline of history.","Cultural,Japan,History,Nonfiction,Writing,Essays,Cultural,Asia,Politics,History,Japanese History,War,World War II,Literature,Asian Literature",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344719892l/10055561.jpg,1595586180,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10055561-ways-of-forgetting-ways-of-remembering,336,4.02,19,"Ways of Forgetting, Ways of Remembering: Japan in the Modern World",126

Stephan detail the factors enabling such campaigns to succeed and, sometimes, causing them to fail. They find that nonviolent resistance presents fewer obstacles to moral and physical involvement and commitment, and that higher levels of participation contribute to enhanced resilience, greater opportunities for tactical innovation and civic disruption (and therefore less incentive for a regime to maintain its status quo), and shifts in loyalty among opponents' erstwhile supporters, including members of the military establishment.,Chenoweth and Stephan conclude that successful nonviolent resistance ushers in more durable and internally peaceful democracies, which are less likely to regress into civil war. Presenting a rich, evidentiary argument, they originally and systematically compare violent and nonviolent outcomes in different historical periods and geographical contexts, debunking the myth that violence occurs because of structural and environmental factors and that it is necessary to achieve certain political goals. Instead, the authors discover, violent insurgency is rarely justifiable on strategic grounds.","Politics,Nonfiction,History,Social Issues,Activism,Politics,Political Science,Sociology,Social Movements,Social Justice,Social Justice,Social Change,Social Science,Academic",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1310471060l/10056014.jpg,231156820,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10056014-why-civil-resistance-works,320,4.06,43,Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict,343

Bill Lucas,Paperback,"Lucas offers a revolutionary understanding of how mankinds brains are pre-wired to learn and the practical steps to take in order to participate fully in the process.,Bill Lucas, a leading international expert on life-long learning, shows that while we have learned more about how the brain works in the last decade than we have ever known, only a fraction of this is grasped and applied by most people. Power Up Your Mind applies this practical knowledge for the first time and shows you how to learn. Drawing on research from a wide variety of subject areas, from neuroscience to psychology, from motivation theory to accelerated learning, from memory to diet, this book shows how everyone has the capacity to succeed and how most people use only a very small portion of their talents. For learning to be effective, an understanding of how the brain works is essential and unlike most of the recent thinking on the mind, Lucas connects an understanding of the brain with the reality of the workplace and translates what we know about the brain into useful insights for work. Much work-based training is a waste of time and money because the majority of people are neither emotionally ready nor practically inclined to apply their learning to the way they behave.

"James D. Bradley,Ron Powers",Paperback,"In this unforgettable chronicle of perhaps the most famous moment in American military history, James Bradley has captured the glory, the triumph, the heartbreak, and the legacy of the six men who raised the flag at Iwo Jima. Here is the true story behind the immortal photograph that has come to symbolize the courage and indomitable will of America.,In February 1945, American Marines plunged into the surf at Iwo Jima—and into history. Through a hail of machine-gun and mortar fire that left the beaches strewn with comrades, they battled to the island's highest peak. And after climbing through a landscape of hell itself, they raised a flag.,Now the son of one of the flagraisers has written a powerful account of six very different young men who came together in a moment that will live forever.,To his family, John Bradley never spoke of the photograph or the war. But after his death at age seventy, his family discovered closed boxes of letters and photos. In ,Flags of Our Fathers,, James Bradley draws on those documents to retrace the lives of his father and the men of Easy Company. Following these men's paths to Iwo Jima, James Bradley has written a classic story of the heroic battle for the Pacific's most crucial island—an island riddled with Japanese tunnels and 22,000 fanatic defenders who would fight to the last man.,But perhaps the most interesting part of the story is what happened after the victory. The men in the photo—three were killed during the battle—were proclaimed heroes and flown home, to become reluctant symbols. For two of them, the adulation was shattering.

Renowned artist Brian Froud and scholar Ari Berk have conducted a thorough investigation into the goblin realm. (For the uninformed, goblins, a subspecies of faery, are those maleficent creatures that cause all manner of havoc in the human realm.) The fruit of their labor, however, turned out to be a rotten apple: the book is infected with goblins. ,Now, thanks largely to Froud and Berk's continuing carelessness, the noxious, viscid, and largely nonsensical volume has been unleashed on an unsuspecting public. Among its pages are reproductions of the ancient, odoriferous Codex Goblinensis; a glossary of common goblins and their markings; and a gazetteer of goblin photographs taken with the arcane Goblin Camera. Those fearing an infestation can refer to the section detailing how to determine if you've ""got goblins"" and, if so, what you can do about it.

Terry Pickard,ebook,"On the 22nd of April 1995 more than 4,000 Rwandans were massacred and thousands more injured in a place called Kibeho. Terry Pickard, a seasoned soldier and medic, was one of a 32-strong force of Australian UN peacekeepers in Kibeho on that terrible Saturday. While the United Nations' presence prevented the death toll from being even worse than it was, the massacre continues to haunt him. The rules of engagement that stopped him from intervening in the senseless slaughter and the life and death decisions he was forced to make when dealing with the injured condemned him to more than a decade of recurring nightmares and debilitating flashbacks. The horror and unimaginable tragedy of the Kibeho Massacre still looms large in the lives of Rwandans and the people sent to help the African country. No one who walked away from that day was ever the same again. Combat Medic is a personal account of one Australian soldier who found himself at the centre of events that shocked the world, and the personal toll that he paid. Terry Pickard's army career spanned nearly 20 years. More than 15 years after Rwanda he continues to struggle with post traumatic stress triggered by his experiences.

G. John Ikenberry,Hardcover,"In the second half of the twentieth century, the United States engaged in the most ambitious and far-reaching liberal order building the world had yet seen. This liberal international order has been one of the most successful in history in providing security and prosperity to more people. But in the last decade, the American-led order has been troubled. Some argue that the Bush administration, with its war on terror, invasion of Iraq, and unilateral orientation, undermined this liberal order. Others argue that we are witnessing the end of the American era. ,Liberal Leviathan, engages these debates., G. John Ikenberry argues that the crisis that besets the American-led order is a crisis of authority. A political struggle has been ignited over the distribution of roles, rights, and authority within the liberal international order. But the deeper logic of liberal order remains alive and well. The forces that have triggered this crisis--the rise of non-Western states such as China, contested norms of sovereignty, and the deepening of economic and security interdependence--have resulted from the successful functioning and expansion of the postwar liberal order, not its breakdown. The liberal international order has encountered crises in the past and evolved as a result. It will do so again., Ikenberry provides the most systematic statement yet about the theory and practice of the liberal international order, and a forceful message for policymakers, scholars, and general readers about why America must renegotiate its relationship with the rest of the world and pursue a more enlightened strategy--that of the liberal leviathan.","Politics,History,Political Science,International Relations,Politics,Political Science,Nonfiction,Academic,School",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1391303816l/10060194.jpg,691125589,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10060194-liberal-leviathan,392,3.61,14,"Liberal Leviathan: The Origins, Crisis, and Transformation of the American World Order",163

Herman Brusselmans,Paperback,"'Ex drummer' is het slotdeel van de 'Ex-trilogie', die verder bestaat uit 'Ex schrijver' en 'Ex minnaar' en behoort tot het allerbeste van Herman Brusselmans' omvangrijke oeuvre. In deze hilarische studie van verloedering worden drie onverbeterlijke losers ten tonele gevoerd, die een populaire schrijver engageren als drummer voor hun rockgroepje. De baldadige avonturen van The Feminists, 'de slechtste band die Gent ooit gekend heeft', worden door Brusselman met de gebruikelijke overdrijving en absurditeit neergezet, maar tussen alle mafkezerij door is er opvallend veel plaats voor gevoeligheid en melancholie. En zo wordt er exuberant gesnoven en gescholden, gevochten en gemoord, geneuzeld en geneukt - tot de even onvermijdelijke als verstrekkende conclusie: 'Alles blijft continu onbegrijpelijk, vunzig, in wezen onmenselijk.'","Fiction,European Literature,Dutch Literature,Literature,Humor,Novels,European Literature,Belgian,Anthologies,Collections,Culture,Film,Literature,20th Century",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1472393546l/1006061.jpg,9053332561,9790000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1006061.Ex_drummer,176,3.25,35,Ex-drummer,1331

Stephen Brook,Paperback,"Unconstrained by tradition or viticultural regulation, California winemakers enjoy a freedom that has resulted in a remarkable range of world-class wines. Beautifully illustrated with original photographs and detailed color maps, this guide introduces California wine by exploring the best that the state has to offer —from lush Sonoma Chardonnay to spicy Santa Barbara Syrah to heady Amador Zinfandel. At the heart of the book, award-winning wine writer Stephen Brook offers 90 intimate profiles of top producers—from Napa and Sonoma to the North and Central coasts, the Sierra foothills, and beyond. Brook also includes general information on California wine history, wine culture, grape varieties, and more. Throughout, he searches for the characteristics that make California wine distinctive despite its tremendous diversity—and finds the answer in the state’s unusual climate, especially the shifting interplay between fog and sun, as well as a lively and constant questioning of received ideas about viticulture, vine age, terroir, and winemaking techniques, all of which have helped winemakers to create complexity,individuality, and nuance in their wines.","Alcohol,Wine",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348556441l/10060915.jpg,520266587,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10060915-the-finest-wines-of-california,320,3.67,1,The Finest Wines of California: A Regional Guide to the Best Producers and Their Wines,6

Luke Williams,Hardcover,"An evocative and exquisitely written debut novel about family, empire and money. , , Impressive in its scope and ambition, this first novel is at once a family saga, a book that reimagines the myth of the empire, and a history of objects. ,The Echo Chamber, is narrated by fifty-four- year-old Evie Steppman, who grew up in Nigeria in the 1950s during the last decade of British rule. As a child, Evie exhibited extraordinarily acute powers of hearing; now, alone in an attic in Scotland that is filled with objects from her past and with her powers of hearing starting to fade, she sets out to record her history before it all disintegrates into a meaningless din. Tales of the twelfth-century mapmaker in Palermo, stories whispered by embittered expatriates, and eyewitness accounts from Nigeria's civil war mingle with Evie's memories of her childhood, of her grandfather, a watchmaker who attempted to forge a mechanical likeness of his dead wife, and of her travels across America. Williams's interest in history and storytelling and his talent for evoking multiple voices will remind readers of the work of David Mitchell, Peter Carey, and Jonathan Safran Foer.","Fiction,Western Africa,Nigeria,Historical,Historical Fiction,European Literature,British Literature,Literary Fiction,Cultural,Scotland",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1310828709l/10061270.jpg,670022837,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10061270-the-echo-chamber,384,2.49,27,The Echo Chamber,82

It shows how the ideology of the dominant group in the Zionist movement led to the development of agriculture, thus meeting the preconditions for successful industrialization. Remarkable, if uneven, growth has taken place, with increasing allocations for defense. Regional isolation led to the emphasis on high-quality exports for developed markets that has stimulated the technological base. Israel has benefited from mass immigration and increased access to foreign capital, factors that have transformed the economy. The book includes chapters on the development of the Jewish community in Palestine during the British Mandate; macroeconomic developments and economic policy; globalization and high technology; defense; the economics of the Arab minority; Israeli settlements and relations with the Palestinians; and the role of religion.

Rosalyn Schanzer,Paperback,"Catch the fever! Gold fever swept the nation—and the world—in 1848 when carpenter James Marshall discovered a gold nugget in the American River near John Sutter's mill. As word spread of gold in California, the news set off a westward stampede. Fortune seekers and adventurers poured into California by land and sea, wild with excitement and expectation. ,Rosalyn Schanzer's engaging and humorous book tells the story of these prospectors in their own words. Schanzer has gathered her favorite quotes from journals and letters written by the forty-niners to recount the discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill. Her irresistible narrative also uses newspaper accounts to trace the various routes the forty-niners took from the East Coast to the West, the adventures they experienced along the way, and the challenges they faced on arrival. The characters recount their stories in their own words, in well-researched and authenticated quote bubbles. ,Step into an intensely exciting chapter of American history. Learn about the dreamers who dropped everything to head out west. See who found gold and how. Meet the lucky ones—and the many whose dreams turned to dust. Listen to the intriguing tales of the prospectors, and find out what the gold-diggers did with their newfound wealth. ,To write and research ,Gold Fever!,, Rosalyn Schanzer visited many California Gold Rush historical sites, and took more than 600 photographs of everything from gold nuggets to saloons in order to make her art as accurate and flavorful as possible. With skill and humor she brings historical characters vividly to life and puts the spirit of the age into her vibrant art. History shines brightly on every page of this evocative book.","History,Science,Geography,Nonfiction,Childrens,Picture Books,Historical,Childrens",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320404003l/1006264.jpg,1426300409,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1006264.Gold_Fever_,48,3.89,9,Gold Fever!: Tales from the California Gold Rush,35

"Hamid Ismailov,Robert Chandler",Paperback,"Set mainly in Uzbekistan between 1900 and 1980, this compelling novel introduces to us the inhabitants of the small town of Gilas on the ancient Silk Route. Among those whose stories we hear are Mefody-Jurisprudence, the town's alcoholic intellectual; Father Ioann, a Russian priest; Kara-Musayev the Younger, the chief of police; and Umarali-Moneybags, the old moneylender. Their colorful lives offer a unique and comic picture of a little-known land populated by outgoing Mullahs, incoming Bolsheviks, and a plethora of Uzbeks, Russians, Persians, Jews, Koreans, Tatars, and Gypsies. At the heart of both the town and the novel stands the railway station—a source of income and influence, and a connection to the greater world beyond the town.

Dalai Lama XIV,Paperback,"Galileo, Copernicus, Newton, Niels Bohr, Einstein. Their insights shook our perception of who we are and where we stand in the world, and in their wake have left an uneasy coexistence: science vs. religion, faith vs. empirical inquiry. Which is the keeper of truth? Which is the true path to understanding reality?,After forty years of study with some of the greatest scientific minds, as well as a lifetime of meditative, spiritual, and philosophic study, the Dalai Lama presents a brilliant analysis of why all avenues of inquiry—scientific as well as spiritual—must be pursued in order to arrive at a complete picture of the truth. Through an examination of Darwinism and karma, quantum mechanics and philosophical insight into the nature of reality, neurobiology and the study of consciousness, the Dalai Lama draws significant parallels between contemplative and scientific examinations of reality.,This breathtakingly personal examination is a tribute to the Dalai Lama’s teachers—both of science and spirituality. The legacy of this book is a vision of the world in which our different approaches to understanding ourselves, our universe, and one another can be brought together in the service of humanity.","Nonfiction,Science,Religion,Buddhism,Philosophy,Spirituality,Religion,Audiobook,Science,Physics,Psychology,Religion,Theology",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320558690l/100629.jpg,767920813,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100629.The_Universe_in_a_Single_Atom,224,3.98,566,The Universe in a Single Atom: The Convergence of Science and Spirituality,9187

Colin Tudge,Hardcover,"Here, between the covers of one capacious book, is an illustrated summary of all the creatures that have ever lived, a vast compendium of earth's current and former inhabitants in all their dazzling and infinite diversity., Colin Tudge argues that we are entering a new phase of biology in which, for the first time, biologists are achieving profound insight into life's true diversity and developing the tools to keep track of it. The Variety of Life heralds this new phase. The first part of the book describes why biologists now feel that there could have been as many as 4,000 billion species on Earth since life began. It then discusses the need for classification, beginning with the most basic principles--the strictly practical classification of fishmongers and foresters, who speak of ""shellfish"" and differentiate ""hardwood"" from ""softwood""--and moves on to explore the intriguing deliberations of the modern ""transformed cladists"" and the novel contributions of molecular genetics. Part II describes the creatures themselves. It is divided into 24 sections, each describing a different group, illustrated by nearly 50 double-page spreads which present genealogical ""trees"" that summarize the evolutionary relationships between the creatures in each group. Some sections describe large, comprehensive groups such as the kingdoms of the Animals or the Plants. Others treat similar sub-groups in more detail, such as the Mammals, a class, or the Hominids, a family. In lively and accessible prose, all the significant groups of creatures--both alive and extinct--are described and their relationships clarified., For general readers and serious biologists alike, The Variety of Life offers an unprecedented storehouse of knowledge of life on earth.","Science,Science,Biology,Nonfiction,Biology,Evolution,Environment,Nature,Science,Natural History,History,Animals,Reference,Science Nature",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1346825788l/1006325.jpg,198503113,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1006325.The_Variety_of_Life,684,4.38,11,The Variety of Life: A Survey and a Celebration of All the Creatures that Have Ever Lived,189

Kathryn Masson,Hardcover,"The aura and romance of Old California lives on in this treasury of inviting homes. The California House presents the magic of the ""golden state,"" that land of infinite promise and dreams, the most tangible expression of which can be found in the homes built by early California dreamers. Here domestic visions of tranquility and repose were inventively realized—in stucco or stone, wood and wrought iron, plaster, and glass and tile. Spanish Colonial Revival–style homes with elaborate wrought-iron window grilles, romantic, shadowy interiors, and lush courtyard gardens stand beside other particularly Californian architectural wonders such as the San Francisco Victorian Painted Lady, the Monterey Colonial, Eurekan Queen Anne, and the homey California Arts & Crafts. Including houses designed by luminaries George Washington Smith, Stanford White, Greene & Greene, and Reginald Johnson, this book will fascinate both the architecture aficionado and interior design enthusiasts, as well as the everyday lover of homes.

Stephen James O'Meara,Hardcover,"For more than two centuries, amateur astronomers have earned their stripes by observing the 109 star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies cataloged by French comet hunter Charles Messier. Sir Patrick Moore has compiled a new list of 109 deep-sky delights, the Caldwell Catalog, which covers the entire celestial sphere. Stephen James O'Meara has observed all 109 Caldwell objects and Deep Sky Companions presents his beautiful sketches and detailed visual descriptions and discusses each object's rich history and astrophysical significance. The latest fundamental data on each object are tabulated, and the book's star charts will lead observers to each object's precise location. Stephen James O'Meara is known worldwide for his precise drawings of astronomical objects as seen through the telescope. Among his many astronomical achievements, he was the first to sight Halley's Comet on its 1985 return; he noticed the dark spokes in Saturn's B ring before the Voyager 1 spacecraft imaged them; and he was the first person to determine the rotation period of the distant planet Uranus. The International Astronomical Union named asteroid 3637 O'Meara in his honor. He is also the author of Deep Sky Companions: The Messier Objects (Cambridge, 1998) and co-author with his wife, Donna Donovan O'Meara, of Volcanoes: Passion and Fury (Sky Publishing, 1994).","Science,Astronomy,Science",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348770873l/1006408.jpg,521827965,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1006408.Deep_Sky_Companions,500,4.37,1,Deep-Sky Companions: The Caldwell Objects,30

Now, responding to requests for more as well as to a number of recent exciting discoveries in physics and astronomy, Krauss takes a provocative look at how the laws of physics relate to notions from our popular culture -- not only ,Star Trek,, but other films, shows, and popular lore -- from ,Independence Day, to ,Star Wars, to ,The X-Files.,What's the difference between a flying saucer and a flying pretzel?,Why didn't the aliens in ,Independence Day ,have to bother invading Earth to destroy it?,What's new with warp drives?,What's the most likely scenario for doomsday?,Are ESP and telekinesis impossible?,What do clairvoyance and time travel have in common?,How might quantum mechanics ultimately affect the fate of life in the universe?","Science,Media Tie In,Star Trek,Nonfiction,Science,Physics,Reference,Science Fiction Fantasy,Science,Popular Science,Writing,Essays,Culture,Pop Culture",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1395213446l/100641.jpg,60977574,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100641.Beyond_Star_Trek,208,3.83,27,Beyond Star Trek: From Alien Invasions to the End of Time,462
"George Robert Kepple,Glen W. Sanner",Hardcover,"Amateur astronomers today are exceptionally fortunate to be living in an era when high quality, and very large, optics are so affordable. In the first half of the 20th century the telescope deluxe for the amateur was the 6-inch refractor. However, such telescopes were so expensive that very few amateurs could afford them: the majority of stargazers had to content themselves with instruments in the 60mm range. Consequently, most observing guides published during that time emphasized double and multiple stars, with honorable mention for variable stars and planetary nebulae, objects which do well in long focal length refractors. Webb's 1858 Celestial Objects for Common Telescopes and Olcott's 1936 Field Book of the Skies were not superceded for so many decades simply because the average amateur instrument did not dramatically improve during the century after Webb. By the 1950s the mass-produced or homemade 6-inch parabolic mirror brought medium-sized optics into the price range of the average amateur, and with it the emission nebulae, open clusters, and galaxies that had been seen only as amorphous blobs-if seen at all-in small refractors. The The 1948 Skalnate Pleso Atlas of the Heavens had already displaced the classic Norton's Star Atlas as the frontline sky-chart for amateurs, but the observing guides badly needed rewriting. However, not until the 1970s and Burnham's Celestial Handbook was there an observing guide worthy of the 6-in","Science,Astronomy,Science,Reference",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387745763l/1006423.jpg,943396581,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1006423.The_Night_Sky_Observer_s_Guide_,0,4.74,3,The Night Sky Observer's Guide : Vol. 1,27

Stephen Brumwell,Paperback,"This book examines the experiences of the British Army soldiers, or 'redcoats', who fought in North America and the West Indies between 1755 and 1763. It explores the Army's distinctive society, using new evidence to provide a voice for ordinary soldiers who have previously been ignored by historians. While other books on the period concentrate upon major personalities and events, this study examines events from the perspective of the individual: the experience of combat, captivity among the Indians, the Army's women and the fate of veterans.

Lawrence M. Krauss,Paperback,"Will the universe continue to expand forever, reverse its expansion and begin to contract, or reach a delicately poised state where it simply persists forever? The answer depends on the amount and properties of matter in the universe, and that has given rise to one of the great paradoxes of modern cosmology: there is too little visible matter to account for the behavior we can see. Over ninety percent of the universe consists of ""missing mass"" or ""dark matter"" - what Lawrence Krauss, in his classic book, termed ""the fifth essence.""In this new edition of T ,he Fifth Essence, , retitled ,Quintessence, after the now widely accepted term for dark matter, Krauss shows how the dark matter problem is now connected with two of the hottest areas in recent cosmology: the fate of the universe and the ""cosmological constant."" With a new introduction, epilogue, and chapter updates, Krauss updates his classic for 1999 and shares one of the most stunning discoveries of recent years: an anti-gravity force that explains recent observations of a permanently expanding universe.","Science,Science,Physics,Nonfiction,Science,Astronomy,Science,Popular Science",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348681883l/100645.jpg,465037410,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100645.Quintessence,384,3.83,14,Quintessence: The Mystery of Missing Mass in the Universe,190

Barry Stimmel,Paperback,"Pain and Its Relief Without Addiction will help people in pain understand why their pain is not always adequately relieved, as well as help reverse the failure of current medical practice to routinely alleviate pain. As noted by a 1992 publication of the United States Department of Health Services, this devastating trend contributes to unnecessary discomfort, longer recovery periods, and compromised patient outcomes. By reading this book, frustrated physicians and, perhaps more importantly, persons in pain can acquire a better understanding of the nature of pain, its connection to the emotions and psychological state of patients, and the impact particular drugs have on the body; this will facilitate relief from pain among a higher percentage of the population.Opioid analgesics comprise many of the chapters in Pain and Its Relief Without Addiction. Author Barry Stimmel, MD, describes the principles to be followed in prescribing opioid analgesics to relieve pain while maintaining one's daily activities without any limitation in function. The available opioids are described, and the differences between them are reviewed to allow you--as a physician, health care provider, or even a patient--to gain a better insight into the one(s) to use for both acute and chronic pain states. The point that is emphasized is that dependency on an analgesic to relieve pain is no different than dependency on medications to lower blood pressure, prevent heart attacks, treat diabetes, etc. What should be avoided is ""addiction,"" a condition where function is impaired rather than enhanced.Pain and Its Relief Without Addiction is a guidebook designed to assist physicians and other health professionals in developing a practical approach to pain management and to give patients a fuller understanding of their pain. You'll gain specific information about:,management of acute and chronic pain,pain in children,pain and cancer,pain and AIDS,psychological support of persons in pain,theories of pain perception,the anatomy of painIn Pain and Its Relief Without Addiction, you'll learn the basic concepts of drug dependence, tolerance, and withdrawal, the pharmacological actions and side effects of drugs used to provide analgesia, and the fundamental steps to be taken in proper pharmacological treatment of pain. The book produces more effective and more informed communication among physicians, other health professionals, and patients so that together they can achieve better pain relief. As Pain and Its Relief Without Addiction illustrates, it is crucial that both patients and physicians understand clearly the terms describing drug use and the behavioral, biochemical, and cellular concepts underlying dependence, tolerance, and withdrawal. Finally, you will acquire a knowledge of all the potential causes of pain and the appropriate steps for intervention.Medical students, new practitioners, and those wishing to reconsider their approaches to pain management will benefit from the book's coverage of general principles for pain control, the use of drug combinations to provide the most effective relief, methods for treating pain in different populations (such as the elderly and persons with chronic medical conditions), and alternative options for failed treatment. The scope of Pain and Its Relief Without Addiction reaches from nonprescription medications, such as aspirin, to NSAIDS, like ibuprofen, to narcotic analgesics to stimulants such as amphetamines and caffeine. It is the most comprehensive book available on various drugs, their desired effects and side effects, and their use to alleviate pain.",,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347506792l/10065046.jpg,789001268,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10065046-pain-and-its-relief-without-addiction,434,3,0,Pain and Its Relief Without Addiction: Clinical Issues in the Use of Opioids and Other Analgesics,1

Marianne Hirsch,Paperback,"Maternal repression is at the basis of the nineteenth-century realist novel. Only with modernism does the mother become a central figure-both celebrated and ambivalent -in daughter-artist's text and family romance. For modernist heroines, psychoanalytic theories of femininity of the 1920s and the 1930s, as well as the novels of Woolf, Colette, and Wharton, show painful oscillations and contradictions between maternal and paternal identifications. Hirsch argues that fictional and theoretical feminist writing still situates itself at uncomfortable distance from the maternal: the concrete stories of mothers are still unspeakable or as Alice Walker says, 'cruel enough to stop the blood.' They point to a feminist discourse of identity which begins with mothers and thereby reframes our conception of self, family, and plot.","Philosophy,Theory",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1383167440l/1006604.jpg,253205328,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1006604.Mother_Daughter_Plot,0,4.04,1,"Mother/Daughter Plot: Narrative, Psychoanalysis, Feminism",24

William Stevenson,Unknown Binding,"The incredible story of an Israeli mission that rescued 103 hostages from a hijacked jetliner.,On June 27, 1976, Air France Flight 139 was hijacked by terrorists and flown to Entebbe Airport in Uganda. In the following agonizing days, Israeli passengers were singled out and held hostage. A week later on July 4, one hundred Israeli commandos raced 2,500 miles from Israel to Entebbe, landed in the middle of the night, and in a heart-stopping mission that lasted ninety minutes, killed all guerillas and freed 103 hostages.,In captivating detail, Stevenson provides a fast-paced hour-by-hour narration from the hijacking to the final ninety-minute mission. In addition to discussing the incredible rescue itself, Stevenson also covers the political backdrop behind the hijacking, especially Ugandan President Idi Amin’s support for the hijackers, which marked one of the first times a leader of a nation had backed terrorist activities. An illustration of one nation’s undying spirit, heroism, and commitment to its people in the face of threat, Operation Thunderbolt has become a legendary antiterrorist tale.,Although first written in 1976 (and published within weeks of the event), Stevenson’s account presents this act of terrorism in a way that is still relevant in our modern-day political climate. A factual account of what could easily be read as sensational fiction, ,90 Minutes at Entebbe, will inspire, encourage, and instill hope in all readers.,Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade imprint, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in history--books about World War II, the Third Reich, Hitler and his henchmen, the JFK assassination, conspiracies, the American Civil War, the American Revolution, gladiators, Vikings, ancient Rome, medieval times, the old West, and much more.

A collection of 25 SF stories by Stephen Baxter, many thematically linked to his ""Manifold"" trilogy (Time, Space and Origin) and other novels of cosmic scope. ""The phase space of a system is the set of all conceivable states of that system"", says the first page. As with ""Manifold"" these stories explore possible (and significantly linked) states of Earth and the universe, alternate timelines offering different solutions to Baxter's favourite cosmological question--the Fermi Paradox. It's a simple idea.,According to our best scientific theories there's nothing special about Earth or the Solar System. Intelligent life has evolved here, ourselves. It's likely to evolve elsewhere. The skies should be full of other intelligences. Where are they? Perhaps our theories are wrong and we're in a galactic quarantine. Perhaps what we see through our telescopes is a clever fake, but supposing we overload the capabilities of the fakers? Maybe intelligence always destroys itself before crossing interstellar space, or something kindly takes emerging life away to a safer place. Perhaps there's teeming intelligence out there, but we're not listening on the right wavelength.

"Trude Dothan,Moshe Dothan",Hardcover,"The Philistines are among the most maligned peoples of ancient history. The Bible characterized them as cunning pagan warmongers, the ancient Egyptians as pirates and marauders. In today's language, a ""philistine"" is an uncouth, uncultured person.,Thanks to the work of Trude Dothan and Moshe Dothan, three thousand years of bad press are at last giving way to a wholly different picture of the Philistines. Through their excavations and other studies, these two eminent archaeologists have unearthed startling answers to some of the great mysteries of biblical history, revealing the Philistines as a highly civilized people. They were advanced artisans and craftsmen, sophisticated architects and ecologically minded town planners.,One of the Aegean Sea Peoples who settled on the southern coast of Canaan at the end of the twelfth century B.C., the Philistines entered history as the main adversaries of the Israelites, stigmatized by the wicked Delilah and the arrogant Goliath. While the nature of their written language is still a mystery, the nature of their civilization is not. The remains of monumental buildings, a flourishing olive-oil industry, cast bronze, iron, and ivory artifacts, weaving looms, wine presses, and a wide range of artistically distinctive pottery urge us to make a historical reassessment.,In People of the Sea, the world's preeminent authorities on Philistine history and culture provide the first popular account of their ground-breaking work. Handsomely illustrated with line drawings, photographs, and maps, the book interweaves a fascinating history of the rise and fall of the Philistines with the first-person experiences of archaeologists at work. The result is a work that not only dramatically changes our understanding of an important and legendary era but also serves to illuminate an ancient civilization long lost to history.","History,Ancient History,History,Archaeology,History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1308409995l/1007124.jpg,25322613,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1007124.People_of_the_Sea,0,4.19,6,People of the Sea: The Search for the Philistines,37

Colin Tudge,Hardcover,"Tradition has it that agriculture began in the Middle East around 10,000 years ago, that once people realized the advantages of farming, it spread rapidly to the furthest outposts of the world, and that this led to the Neolithic Revolution and the end of the hunting-gathering lifestyle. In this book Colin Tudge argues that agriculture in some form was in the repertoire of our ancestors for thousands of years before the Neolithic farming revolution: people did not suddenly invent forced into it over a long period. What we see in the Neolithic Revolution is not the beginning of agriculture on a large scale, in one place, with refined tools.,Drawing on a wide range of evidence from fossil records to the Bible, Tudge offers a persuasive hypothesis about a puzzling epoch in our past. In so doing, he provides new insights into the Pleistocene overkill, the demise of the Neanderthals, the location of the biblical Eden, and much more.","History,Science,Anthropology,Nonfiction,History,Prehistory,Science,Agriculture",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347292428l/1007157.jpg,300080247,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1007157.Neanderthals_Bandits_and_Farmers,64,3.74,14,"Neanderthals, Bandits and Farmers: How Agriculture Really Began",87

Colin Tudge,Paperback,"So Shall We Reap: How Everyone Who Is Liable to Be Born in the Next Ten Thousand Years Could Eat Very Well Indeed; and Why, in Practice, Our Immediate Descendants Are Likely to Be in Serious Trouble,, award-winning writer Colin Tudge's latest book, has a revealing if lengthy subtitle ,How everyone who is liable to be born in the next ten thousand years could eat very well indeed; and why, in practice, our immediate descendants are likely to be in serious trouble,. Tudge is a Cambridge zoology graduate who has worked as a science journalist and has written several well known and very successful books on agriculture and conservation (such as,Food Crops for the Future,), genetics (,In Mendel's Footnotes,) and evolution (,The Variety of Life,). ,So Shall We Reap, combines all these strands in an impassioned plea for global change in current farming practice. Tudge argues that at present there are good reasons for thinking we are getting it wrong. For instance, one of the most glaring and obscene disparities is that while famine is common, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, the developed world has food surpluses and is suffering from what the World Health Organisation calls a ""global epidemic"" of obesity. , Tudge examines the nature of the problem, then castigates the main players--the agribusiness, the bio technicians and other scientists who have been seduced by the lure of big bucks and quick fixes and then embarks on his own solution, what he calls ""Enlightened Agriculture""--appealing to the better use of some basic rules of biology and ecological models and the development of more labour intensive mixed economies which will help maintain rural society. A detailed argument of the new agricultural revolution is presented here; Tudge suggests that the hammer and sickle has been replaced by a pc with access to the Internet. --,Douglas Palmer","Nonfiction,Food and Drink,Food,Politics,Science,Agriculture",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1180179289l/1007163._SY475_.jpg,141009500,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1007163.So_Shall_We_Reap,451,4,3,So Shall We Reap: What's Gone Wrong with the World's Food--And How to Fix It,57

Nick Hornby,Hardcover,"In his eagerly awaited fourth novel, ,New York Times,-bestselling author Nick Hornby mines the hearts and psyches of four lost souls who connect just when they've reached the end of the line. ,Meet Martin, JJ, Jess, and Maureen. Four people who come together on New Year's Eve: a former TV talk show host, a musician, a teenage girl, and a mother. Three are British, one is American. They encounter one another on the roof of Topper's House, a London destination famous as the last stop for those ready to end their lives. ,In four distinct and riveting first-person voices, Nick Hornby tells a story of four individuals confronting the limits of choice, circumstance, and their own mortality. This is a tale of connections made and missed, punishing regrets, and the grace of second chances. ,Intense, hilarious, provocative, and moving, ,A Long Way Down, is a novel about suicide that is, surprisingly, full of life. ,What's your jumping-off point? ,Maureen,Why is it the biggest sin of all? All your life you're told that you'll be going to this marvelous place when you pass on. And the one thing you can do to get you there a bit quicker is something that stops you getting there at all. Oh, I can see that it's a kind of queue-jumping. But if someone jumps the queue at the post office, people tut. Or sometimes they say ""Excuse me, I was here first."" They don't say ""You will be consumed by hellfire for all eternity."" That would be a bit strong. ,Martin,I'd spent the previous couple of months looking up suicides on the Internet, just out of curiosity. And nearly every single time, the coroner says the same thing: ""He took his own life while the balance of his mind was disturbed."" And then you read the story about the poor bastard: His wife was sleeping with his best friend, he'd lost his job, his daughter had been killed in a road accident some months before . . . Hello, Mr. Coroner? I'm sorry, but there's no disturbed mental balance here, my friend. I'd say he got it just right. ,Jess,I was at a party downstairs. It was a shit party, full of all these ancient crusties sitting on the floor drinking cider and smoking huge spliffs and listening to weirdo space-out reggae. At midnight, one of them clapped sarcastically, and a couple of others laughed, and that was it-Happy New Year to you, too. You could have turned up to that party as the happiest person in London, and you'd still have wanted to jump off the roof by five past twelve. And I wasn't the happiest person in London anyway. Obviously. ,JJ,New Year's Eve was a night for sentimental losers. It was my own stupid fault. Of course there'd be a low-rent crowd up there. I should have picked a classier date-like March 28, when Virginia Woolf took her walk into the river, or November 25 (Nick Drake). If anybody had been on the roof on either of those nights, the chances are they would have been like-minded souls, rather than hopeless f*ck-ups who had somehow persuaded themselves that the end of a calendar year is in any way significant.","Fiction,Contemporary,Humor,Novels,European Literature,British Literature,Adult Fiction,Adult,Audiobook,Health,Mental Health,Literature",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1467861525l/10073._SX318_.jpg,1594481938,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10073.A_Long_Way_Down,368,3.44,5139,A Long Way Down,83767

"Charles Sanders Peirce,Kenneth Laine Ketner",Paperback,"Charles Sanders Peirce (1839-1914) was an American philosopher, physicist, mathematician, and the founder of pragmatism. Despite his importance in the history of philosophy, a unified statement of his thought has been unavailable. With this publication, readers at long last are offered the philosopher's only known, complete, and coherent account of his own work. Originally delivered as the Cambridge Conferences Lectures of 1898, ,Reasoning and the Logic of Things, is the most accessible and thorough introduction to Peirce's mature thought to be found within the compass of a single book.,Beginning with an explanation of the nature of philosophy, Peirce proceeds to illustrate his claim that mathematics provides the foundation of our logic and metaphysics. We find here the clearest formulation of an idea present in Peirce's thought since the 1860s, the distinction between three kinds of reasoning: induction, deduction, and retroduction. Then follows an introduction to Peirce's chief logical doctrines, as well as his attempts to provide a classification of the sciences, a theory of categories, and a theory of science. In conclusion, turning from ""reasoning"" to the ""logic of things,"" Peirce called for an evolutionary cosmology to explain the reality of laws and described the kinds of reasoning he employed in developing this cosmology.,At the urging of his friend William James, Peirce made an uncharacteristic effort in these lectures to present his ideas in terms intelligible to a general audience--those without advanced training in logic and philosophy. The introductory materials by Kenneth Ketner and Hilary Putman add to the volume's lucidity. Consequently, this book will be a valuable source for readers outside of the circle of Peirce specialists.","Philosophy,Philosophy,Logic",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349053301l/1007468.jpg,674749677,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1007468.Reasoning_and_the_Logic_of_Things,312,4.45,0,Reasoning and the Logic of Things: The Cambridge Conferences Lectures of 1898,11

Anabel Hernández,Paperback,"Los señores del narco es una descarnada crónica sobre las alarmantes complicidades de los altos círculos políticos, policiacos, militares y empresariales con el crimen organizado. Anabel Hernández tuvo acceso no sólo a una vasta documentación, inédita hasta hoy, sino a testimonios directos de autoridades y expertos en el tema, así como de personas involucradas con los principales cárteles mexicanos de la droga. Esto le ha permitido examinar rigurosamente el origen de la sangrienta lucha por el poder entre los grupos criminales, y cuestionar la ""guerra"" del gobierno federal contra la delincuencia organizada. Al investigar las intrincadas redes de contubernios, la autora tuvo que remontarse a la década de 1970, cuando se controlaba el tráfico de enervantes haciendo que los narcos prácticamente pagaran impuestos al gobierno. En su inquietante recorrido avanza hacia los años ochenta, cuando los jefes de la organización criminal del Pacífico, auspiciados por la CIA, incursionaron en el jugoso negocio de la cocaína, y nos conduce hasta el surgimiento de poderosos capos como los hermanos Beltrán Leyva, Ismael El Mayo Zambada o Joaquín Guzmán Loera, quienes lograron penetrar las estructuras del Estado y ponerlas a su servicio. Tras echar abajo el mito de la fuga de El Chapo de la prisión de Puente Grande en un carrito de lavandería, este libro narra su ascenso en la jerarquía del crimen y cómo ha llevado hasta sus últimas y terribles consecuencias un ""pacto de impunidad"" con numerosos funcionarios públicos y hombres de negocios. Este libro, en suma, se presenta como un impactante viaje al interior del mundo del narcotráfico para buscar los poderosos resortes que lo mueven, y los ha descubierto con nombre y apellido.","Nonfiction,History,Politics,Mystery,Crime,Writing,Journalism,Crime,True Crime,Historical,Biography,War,Cultural",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1340760267l/10074858.jpg,607310104X,9790000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10074858-los-se-ores-del-narco,592,4.03,178,Los señores del narco,1375

Stephen Holloway,Paperback,"This third edition of Straight and Level thoroughly updates the previous edition with extensive comments on recent industry developments and emerging business models. The discussion is illustrated by current examples drawn from all sectors of the industry and every region of the world. The fundamental structure of earlier editions, now widely used as a framework for air transport management courses, nonetheless remains unchanged. Part 1 of the book provides a strategic context within which to consider the industry's economics. Part 2 is built around a simple yet powerful model that relates operating revenue to operating cost; it examines the most important elements in demand and traffic, price and yield, output and unit cost. Part 3 probes more deeply into three critical aspects of capacity management: network management; fleet management; and revenue management. Part 4 concludes the book by exploring relationships between unit revenue, unit cost, yield, and load factor. Straight and Level has been written primarily for masters-level students on aviation management courses.

"Fran Ross,Harryette Mullen",Paperback,"One of a few works of satire written by African American women, ,Oreo, is an uproariously funny novel about relations between African Americans and Jews. It is as fresh and outrageous today as when it was first published in 1974.,Born of a Jewish father and black mother, Oreo grows up in Philadelphia with her grandparents while her mother tours with a theatrical group. Soon after puberty Oreo heads for New York to search for her father, but in the big city she discovers that there are dozens of Sam Schwartzes. Oreo's mission turns into a wickedly humorous picaresque quest, reminiscent of the ancient Greek myth of Theseus. This is an ambitious and playful narrative that challenges not only the accepted notions of race, ethnicity, and identity, but also those of the novelistic form itself.","Fiction,Humor,Race,Novels,Cultural,African American,Classics,Literature,Jewish,The United States Of America,Literary Fiction,American,African American Literature",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1358755478l/1007499.jpg,1555534643,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1007499.Oreo,212,3.65,442,Oreo,2310
Leonard Shlain,Paperback,"Why did big-brained ,Homo sapiens, suddenly emerge some 150,000 years ago? The key, according to Leonard Shlain, is female sexuality. Drawing on an awesome breadth of research, he shows how, long ago, the narrowness of the newly bipedal human female's pelvis and the increasing size of infants' heads precipitated a crisis for the species. ,Natural selection allowed for the adaptation of the human female to this environmental stress by reconfiguring her hormonal cycles, entraining them with the periodicity of the moon. The results, however, did much more than ensure our existence; they imbued women with the concept of time, and gave them control over sex--a power that males sought to reclaim. And the possibility of achieving immortality through heirs drove men to construct patriarchal cultures that went on to dominate so much of human history.,From the nature of courtship to the evolution of language, Shlain's brilliant and wide-ranging exploration stimulates new ways of thinking about very old matters.,"",A masterpiece of ideas and a unique contribution to our understanding of gender and history, sexuality and evolution,."", -- Jean Houston,[,Note: includes Reader's Guide,]","Nonfiction,Science,History,Sexuality,Feminism,Anthropology,Gender,Biology,Evolution,Psychology,Sociology",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309206986l/100749.jpg,142004677,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100749.Sex_Time_and_Power,464,4.05,132,"Sex, Time, and Power: How Women's Sexuality Shaped Human Evolution",1340

Meghan MacLean Weir,Hardcover,"When Dr. Meghan Weir first dons her scrubs and steps onto the floor of Children’s Hospital Boston as a newly minted resident, her head is packed with medical-school-textbook learning. She knows the ins and outs of the human body, has memorized the correct way to perform hundreds of complicated procedures, and can recite the symptoms of any number of diseases by rote. But none of that has truly prepared her for what she is about to experience. ,From the premature infants Dr. Weir is expected to care for on her very first day of residency to the frustrating teenagers who visit the ER at three in the morning for head colds, each day brings with it new challenges and new lessons. Dr. Weir learns that messiness, fear, and uncertainty live beneath the professional exterior of the doctor’s white coat. Yet, in addition to the hardships, the practice of medicine comes with enormous rewards of joy, camaraderie, and the triumph of healing. ,The three years of residency—when young doctors who have just graduated from medical school take on their own patients for the first time—are grueling in any specialty. But there is a unique challenge to dealing with patients too young to describe where it hurts, and it is not just having to handle their parents. In Between Expectations: Lessons from a Pediatric Residency, Dr. Weir takes readers into the nurseries, ICUs, and inpatient rooms of one of the country’s busiest hospitals for children, revealing a world many of us never get to see. With candor and humility, she explores the many humbling lessons that all residents must learn: that restraint is sometimes the right treatment option, no matter how much you want to act; that some patients, even young teenagers, aren’t interested in listening to the good advice that will make their lives easier; that parents ultimately know their own children far better than their doctors ever will. ,Dr. Weir’s thoughtful prose reveals how exhaustion and doubt define the residency experience just as much as confidence and action do. Yet the most important lesson that she learns through the months and years of residency is that having a good day on the floor does not always mean that a patient goes home miraculously healed—more often than not, success is about a steady, gradual discovery of strength. By observing the children, the parents, and other hospital staff who painstakingly provide care each day, Dr. Weir finds herself finally developing into the physician (and the parent) she hopes to become. These stories—sometimes funny, sometimes haunting—expose the humanity that is so often obscured by the doctor’s white coat.","Health,Medicine,Medical,Nonfiction,Autobiography,Memoir,Biography,Biography,Autobiography",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348966727l/10076317.jpg,1439189072,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10076317-between-expectations,288,3.65,40,Between Expectations: Lessons from a Pediatric Residency,365

Nelly S. Toll,Hardcover,"For thirteen months during World War II, Nelly Toll and her mother were hidden from the Nazis in the small bedroom of a Gentile couple in Lwow, Poland. Just eight years old when she went into hiding in 1943, Nelly began keeping the diary that would inspire this powerful and moving memoir of her childhood. In her small black journal Nelly wrote about the heartbreaking events she experienced in Lwow and her grief over the tragic losses of family members, as well as the day-to-day fears of life in hiding. In contrast, the exuberant, vividly colored paintings that Nelly also produced while in hiding transformed her grim reality into an enchanting fantasy world filled with school friends, bright skies, and happy families.

"Joel R. Primack,Nancy Ellen Abrams",Hardcover,"A world-renowned astrophysicist and a science philosopher present a new, scientifically supported understanding of the universe, one that will forever change our personal relationship with the cosmos. , For four hundred years, since early scientists discovered that the universe did not revolve around the earth, people have felt cut off-adrift in a meaningless cosmos. That is about to change. , In their groundbreaking new book, ,The View from the Center of the Universe,, Joel R. Primack, Ph.D., one of the world's leading cosmologists, and Nancy Ellen Abrams, a philosopher and writer, use recent advances in astronomy,physics, and cosmology to frame a compelling new theory of how to understand the universe and our role in it. , While most of us think of the universe as empty space peppered with stars separated by vast distances, the truth, the authors argue, is far richer and more meaningful. For the first time in history, we know that the universe is more coherent and spiritually significant than anyone ever imagined and that our place in it is actually central to the expanding universe in important ways. , According to Primack and Abrams, this new cosmology clarifies how the universe operates, what it's made of, how it may have originated, and how it is evolving. Even more surprising, these startling ideas spring from both cutting-edge science and the metaphors of ancient symbols. The result is a very human book that satisfies our fundamental need for order and meaning in our world and in our lives.","Science,Nonfiction,Philosophy,History,Science,Astronomy,Philosophy,Metaphysics,Science,Physics,Science Nature",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442005387l/1000077._SY475_.jpg,1594489149,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1000077.The_View_from_the_Center_of_the_Universe,400,4,38,The View from the Center of the Universe: Discovering Our Extraordinary Place in the Cosmos,406
Anthony Clayton,Paperback,"This suvery draws together into a single integrated account the two major wars of decolonization fought by France in Indochina (in the early 1950's) and Algeria (in the late 1950's), as well as the smaller but far from insignificant military operations that the French conducted in Madagascar, Tunisia and Morocco.,Fought at different times and in very different theatres, these conflicts - little explored in English-language scholarship as yet - have tended to be seen in isolation. By bringing them together within the covers of a single succinct analytical survey, and treating them as different manifestations of the same historical process, a major gap is filled in the literature about modern France, decolonization, and postwar military history alike.,The military operations are set in their widest context. Among the themes explored in detail are: ,- the traditional French attitudes to empire, and how these changed under the pressure of events;,- the French Army's counter-revolutionairy warfare school in the 1950's, and its politically dangerous doctrines;,- the collapse of the Fourth Republic and the return to power of de Gaulle;,- the final drama of withdrawal from Algeria, with its 'ethnic cleaning' of the European settler population.,A model of clear exposition, the study offers fascinating opportunities for comparison with the more familiar decolonization process in the British Empire (on the military aspects of which a volume will be published in the series in due course).

Jenny Edkins,Hardcover,"An analytical look at the ways we define and respond to famine. ,We see famine and look for the likely causes: poor food distribution, unstable regimes, caprices of weather. A technical problem, we tell ourselves, one that modern social and natural science will someday resolve. To the contrary, Jenny Edkins responds in this book: Famine in the contemporary world is not the antithesis of modernity but its symptom. A critical investigation of hunger, famine, and aid practices in international politics, Whose Hunger? shows how the forms and ideas of modernity frame our understanding of famine-and, consequently, shape our responses. ,Edkins examines Malthus and the origins of famine theory in notions of scarcity. Drawing on the work of Lacan, de Waal, Foucault, Zizek, and particularly Derrida, she considers Amartya Sen's entitlement approach, the Band Aid/Live Aid events, and food for work projects in Eritrea as examples of the technologization and repoliticization of famine.

Why do Mexicans love to see themselves as victims, but also love victims? And why, though the Mexican people traditionally avoid conflict, is there so much violence in a country where many leaders have died by assassination? ,In this shrewd and fascinating book, the renowned scholar and former foreign minister Jorge Castañeda sheds much light on the puzzling paradoxes of his native country. Here’s a nation of 110 million that has an ambivalent and complicated relationship with the United States yet is host to more American expatriates than any country in the world. Its people tend to resent foreigners yet have made the nation a hugely popular tourist destination. Mexican individualism and individual ties to the land reflect a desire to conserve the past and slow the route to uncertain modernity. ,Castañeda examines the future possibilities for Mexico as it becomes more diverse in its regional identities, socially more homogenous, its character and culture the instruments of change rather than sources of stagnation, its political system more open and democratic. ,Mañana Forever?, is a compelling portrait of a nation at a crossroads.","Nonfiction,History,Cultural,Politics",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320446300l/10002494.jpg,375404244,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10002494-ma-ana-forever-mexico-and-the-mexicans,320,3.62,47,Mañana Forever?

George H. Nash,Hardcover,"National Review has called a ""magisterial work of scholarship on one of our least-known presidents, and an important era in American history.""The entry of the United States into the First World War in late 1911 found Herbert Hoover at a crossroads. Three years earlier, he had been a successful mining engineer in London. Then, as the war intensified in Europe, Hoover founded and led the Commission for Relief in Belgium, which provided desperately needed fuel to more than nine million Belgian and French citizens trapped between the German army of occupation and the British naval blockade. That emergency undertaking eventually evolved into one of the greatest humanitarian enterprises in history. It also brought Hoover into international prominence.Here Herbert Hoover moves toward Washington and center stage in his own country. Shortly after the United States's declaration of war, he entered into able service under Woodrow Wilson as a member of the President's War Cabinet and U.S. Food Administration. His goal was to standardize food production to control surging food prices, and to create surpluses of exportable foodstuffs for America's allies. ""Food will win the war"" became Hoover's slogan.Hoover encountered the tumult of district politics and became both agent and catalyst of the moment in American lives when a traditionally decentralized economy was coming under price control and other forms of governmental restraint. We see Hoover as builder and bureaucrat, a man who brought force, drive, and ability into the service of his country.","Politics,Presidents,History,Biography,Biography Memoir",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348838567l/1000249.jpg,393038416,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1000249.The_Life_of_Herbert_Hoover_Volume_3,672,3.83,0,"The Life of Herbert Hoover, Volume 3: Master of Emergencies, 1917-1918",6

He presents a concise history of the development of nuclear physics leading up to the emergence of the nuclear power industry and discusses the nature of nuclear energy and the various aspects of public concern, including the risks of nuclear safety, the cost of its development, and the problems of waste disposal. The book looks specifically at safety records, including accounts of the Windscale fire, the Three Mile Island incident, and the Chernobyl disaster. As he dispels much of the widespread confusion about nuclear energy, Irvine argues for the relevance of nuclear power to the ongoing energy crisis and encourages informed debate about its potential.","Science,Science,Physics,Nonfiction,Science,Engineering,History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348275555l/10002554.jpg,199584974,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10002554-nuclear-power,144,3.96,9,Nuclear Power: A Very Short Introduction,69

"Frederick W. Byron Jr.,Robert W.  Fuller",Paperback,"This textbook is designed to complement graduate-level physics texts in classical mechanics, electricity, magnetism, and quantum mechanics. Organized around the central concept of a vector space, the book includes numerous physical applications in the body of the text as well as many problems of a physical nature. It is also one of the purposes of this book to introduce the physicist to the language and style of mathematics as well as the content of those particular subjects with contemporary relevance in physics.,Chapters 1 and 2 are devoted to the mathematics of classical physics. Chapters 3, 4 and 5 — the backbone of the book — cover the theory of vector spaces. Chapter 6 covers analytic function theory. In chapters 7, 8, and 9 the authors take up several important techniques of theoretical physics — the Green's function method of solving differential and partial differential equations, and the theory of integral equations. Chapter 10 introduces the theory of groups. The authors have included a large selection of problems at the end of each chapter, some illustrating or extending mathematical points, others stressing physical application of techniques developed in the text.,Essentially self-contained, the book assumes only the standard undergraduate preparation in physics and mathematics, i.e. intermediate mechanics, electricity and magnetism, introductory quantum mechanics, advanced calculus and differential equations. The text may be easily adapted for a one-semester course at the graduate or advanced undergraduate level.","Science,Physics,Science,Mathematics,Science,Reference,Textbooks,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328862658l/100026.jpg,048667164X,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100026.Mathematics_of_Classical_and_Quantum_Physics,672,4.28,6,Mathematics of Classical and Quantum Physics,140

David Crump,Paperback,"How are we to understand petitionary prayer? This is a key question for any thoughtful believer who desires to take both the Bible and experience seriously. Some believe God answers any prayer as long as the one praying has enough faith and/or persistence. Others conclude from experience that prayer is really for our benefit and has no impact on God's actions. According to David Crump, both views are extreme and potentially harmful.,While books that deal with prayer from a devotional or experiential perspective have their value, ,Knocking on Heaven's Door ,takes a different approach. Crump carefully studies every New Testament passage that has to do with petitionary prayer and draws conclusions that are both theological and pastoral to help us understand the great mystery of prayer.","Prayer,Religion,Theology",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348602925l/1000275.jpg,080102689X,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1000275.Knocking_on_Heaven_s_Door,345,4.39,6,Knocking on Heaven's Door: A New Testament Theology of Petitionary Prayer,28
"Thomas    Williams,Andre Dubus III",Paperback,"In 1975 the National Book Award Fiction Prize was awarded to two writers: Robert Stone and Thomas Williams. Yet only Stone's ,Dog Soldiers, is still remembered today. That oversight is startling when considering the literary impact of ,The Hair of Harold Roux,. A dazzlingly crafted novel-within-a-novel hailed as a masterpiece, it deserves a new generation of readers. ,In The Hair of Harold Roux,, we are introduced to Aaron Benham: college professor, writer, husband, and father. Aaron-when he can focus-is at work on a novel, ,The Hair of Harold Roux,, a thinly disguised autobiographical account of his college days. In Aaron's novel, his alter ego, Allard Benson, courts a young woman, despite the efforts of his rival, the earnest and balding Harold Roux-a GI recently returned from World War II with an unfortunate hairpiece. What unfolds through Aaron's mind, his past and present, and his nested narratives is a fascinating exploration of sex and friendship, responsibility and regret, youth and middle age, and the essential fictions that see us through.","Fiction,Novels,Classics,Literary Fiction,Literature,Language,Writing,American,Americana,Adult Fiction,Contemporary,Literature,American",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312232829l/10002787.jpg,160819583X,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10002787-the-hair-of-harold-roux,400,3.7,67,The Hair of Harold Roux,387
"Bruce Rosenblum,Fred Kuttner",Hardcover,"The most successful theory in all of science--and the basis of one third of our economy--says the strangest things about the world and about us. Can you believe that physical reality is created by our observation of it? Physicists were forced to this conclusion, the quantum enigma, by what they observed in their laboratories.,Trying to understand the atom, physicists built quantum mechanics and found, to their embarrassment, that their theory intimately connects consciousness with the physical world. ,Quantum Enigma, explores what that implies and why some founders of the theory became the foremost objectors to it. Schr�dinger showed that it absurdly allowed a cat to be in a superposition simultaneously dead and alive. Einstein derided the theory's spooky interactions. With Bell's Theorem, we now know Schr�dinger's superpositions and Einstein's spooky interactions indeed exist.,Authors Bruce Rosenblum and Fred Kuttner explain all of this in non-technical terms with help from some fanciful stories and bits about the theory's developers. They present the quantum mystery honestly, with an emphasis on what is and what is not speculation.,Physics' encounter with consciousness is its skeleton in the closet. Because the authors open the closet and examine the skeleton, theirs is a controversial book. ,Quantum Enigma's, description of the experimental quantum facts, and the quantum theory explaining them, is undisputed. Interpreting what it all means, however, is controversial.,Every interpretation of quantum physics encounters consciousness. Rosenblum and Kuttner therefore turn to exploring consciousness itself--and encounter quantum physics. Free will and anthropic principles become crucial issues, and the connection of consciousness with the cosmos suggested by some leading quantum cosmologists is mind-blowing.,Readers are brought to a boundary where the particular expertise of physicists is no longer a sure guide. They will find, instead, the facts and hints provided by quantum mechanics and the ability to speculate for themselves.","Science,Science,Physics,Nonfiction,Physics,Quantum Mechanics,Philosophy,Spirituality,Psychology,Science,Popular Science,Biology,Neuroscience,Science,Mathematics",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348371268l/100027.jpg,019517559X,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100027.Quantum_Enigma,211,4.11,153,Quantum Enigma: Physics Encounters Consciousness,1999
Samuel A. Floyd Jr.,Hardcover,"When Jimi Hendrix transfixed the crowds of Woodstock with his gripping version of The Star Spangled Banner, he was building on a foundation reaching back, in part, to the revolutionary guitar playing of Howlin' Wolf and the other great Chicago bluesmen, and to the Delta blues tradition before him. But in its unforgettable introduction, followed by his unaccompanied talking guitar passage and inserted calls and responses at key points in the musical narrative, Hendrix's performance of the national anthem also hearkened back to a tradition even older than the blues, a tradition rooted in the rings of dance, drum, and song shared by peoples across Africa.,Bold and original, ,The Power of Black Music, offers a new way of listening to the music of black America, and appreciating its profound contribution to all American music. Striving to break down the barriers that remain between high art and low art, it brilliantly illuminates the centuries-old linkage between the music, myths and rituals of Africa and the continuing evolution and enduring vitality of African-American music. Inspired by the pioneering work of Sterling Stuckey and Henry Louis Gates, Jr., author Samuel A. Floyd, Jr, advocates a new critical approach grounded in the forms and traditions of the music itself. He accompanies readers on a fascinating journey from the African ring, through the ring shout's powerful merging of music and dance in the slave culture, to the funeral parade practices of the early new Orleans jazzmen, the bluesmen in the twenties, the beboppers in the forties, and the free jazz, rock, Motown, and concert hall composers of the sixties and beyond. Floyd dismisses the assumption that Africans brought to the United States as slaves took the music of whites in the New World and transformed it through their own performance practices. Instead, he recognizes European influences, while demonstrating how much black music has continued to share with its African counterparts. Floyd maintains that while African Americans may not have direct knowledge of African traditions and myths, they can intuitively recognize links to an authentic African cultural memory. For example, in speaking of his grandfather Omar, who died a slave as a young man, the jazz clarinetist Sidney Bechet said, Inside him he'd got the memory of all the wrong that's been done to my people. That's what the memory is....When a blues is good, that kind of memory just grows up inside it. ,Grounding his scholarship and meticulous research in his childhood memories of black folk culture and his own experiences as a musician and listener, Floyd maintains that the memory of Omar and all those who came before and after him remains a driving force in the black music of America, a force with the power to enrich cultures the world over.","Music,History,Nonfiction,Music,Jazz",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347716026l/1000287.jpg,195082354,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1000287.The_Power_of_Black_Music,336,4.22,1,The Power of Black Music: Interpreting Its History from Africa to the United States,37

Edward P. Crapol,Hardcover,"The first vice president to become president on the death of the incumbent, John Tyler (1790-1862) was derided by critics as His Accidency. Yet he proved to be a bold leader who used the malleable executive system to his advantage. In this biography of the tenth President of the United States, Edward P. Crapol challenges previous depictions of Tyler as a die-hard advocate of states' rights, limited government, and a strict interpretation of the Constitution.,In pursuit of his agenda, Crapol argues, Tyler exploited executive prerogatives and manipulated constitutional requirements in ways that violated his professed allegiance to a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He set precedents that his successors in the White House invoked to create an American empire and expand presidential power.,Crapol also highlights Tyler's enduring faith in America's national destiny and his belief that boundless territorial expansion would preserve the Union as a slaveholding republic. When Tyler, a Virginian, opted for secession and the Confederacy in 1861, he was stigmatized as America's traitor president for having betrayed the republic he once led. As Crapol demonstrates, Tyler's story anticipates the modern imperial presidency in all its power and grandeur, as well as its darker side.","Politics,Presidents,Biography,History,Nonfiction,North American Hi...,American History,Presidents,Us Presidents,Politics,Biography Memoir,Literature,American,War",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347336979l/1000303.jpg,807830410,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1000303.John_Tyler_the_Accidental_President,332,3.86,104,"John Tyler, the Accidental President",1932
John Fabian Witt,Paperback,"In the five decades after the Civil War, the United States witnessed a profusion of legal institutions designed to cope with the nation's exceptionally acute industrial accident crisis. Jurists elaborated the common law of torts. Workingmen's organizations founded a widespread system of cooperative insurance. Leading employers instituted welfare-capitalist accident relief funds. And social reformers advocated compulsory insurance such as workmen's compensation.,John Fabian Witt argues that experiments in accident law at the turn of the twentieth century arose out of competing views of the loose network of ideas and institutions that historians call the ideology of free labor. These experiments a century ago shaped twentieth- and twenty-first-century American accident law; they laid the foundations of the American administrative state; and they occasioned a still hotly contested legal transformation from the principles of free labor to the categories of insurance and risk. In this eclectic moment at the beginnings of the modern state, Witt describes American accident law as a contingent set of institutions that might plausibly have developed along a number of historical paths. In turn, he suggests, the making of American accident law is the story of the equally contingent remaking of our accidental republic.","Law,North American Hi...,American History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347757832l/1000304.jpg,674022610,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1000304.The_Accidental_Republic,311,3.5,2,"The Accidental Republic: Crippled Workingmen, Destitute Widows, and the Remaking of American Law",16

Evgeny Morozov,ebook,"""The revolution will be Twittered!"" declared journalist Andrew Sullivan after protests erupted in Iran in June 2009. Yet for all the talk about the democratizing power of the Internet, regimes in Iran and China are as stable and repressive as ever. In fact, authoritarian governments are effectively using the Internet to suppress free speech, hone their surveillance techniques, disseminate cutting-edge propaganda, and pacify their populations with digital entertainment. Could the recent Western obsession with promoting democracy by digital means backfire?,In this spirited book, journalist and social commentator Evgeny Morozov shows that by falling for the supposedly democratizing nature of the Internet, Western do-gooders may have missed how it also entrenches dictators, threatens dissidents, and makes it harder - not easier - to promote democracy. Buzzwords like ""21st-century statecraft"" sound good in PowerPoint presentations, but the reality is that ""digital diplomacy"" requires just as much oversight and consideration as any other kind of diplomacy.,Marshaling compelling evidence, Morozov shows why we must stop thinking of the Internet and social media as inherently liberating and why ambitious and seemingly noble initiatives like the promotion of ""Internet freedom"" might have disastrous implications for the future of democracy as a whole.","Nonfiction,Science,Technology,Computers,Internet,Politics,Science,Sociology,History,Business,Philosophy,Social Science,Social Media",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1297025324l/10003400.jpg,1586488759,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10003400-the-net-delusion,432,3.67,148,The Net Delusion: The Dark Side of Internet Freedom,1700

Joyce Dalsheim,Hardcover,"Joyce Dalsheim's ethnographic study takes a ground-breaking approach to one of the most contentious issues in the Middle East: the Israeli settlement project. Based on fieldwork in the settlements of the Gaza Strip and surrounding communities during the year prior to the Israeli withdrawal, ,Unsettling Gaza, poses controversial questions about the settlement of Israeli occupied territories in ways that move beyond the usual categories of politics, religion, and culture. The book critically examines how religiously-motivated settlers think about living with Palestinians, how they express theological uncertainty, and how they imagine the future beyond the confines of territorial nationalism.,This is the first study to place radical, right-wing settlers and their left-wing and secular opposition in the same analytic frame. Dalsheim shows that the intense antagonism between these groups disguises fundamental similarities. Her analysis reveals the social and cultural work achieved through a politics of mutual denunciation. With theoretical implications stretching far beyond the boundaries of Israel/Palestine, ,Unsettling Gaza,'s counter-intuitive findings shed fresh light on politics and identity among Israelis and the troubling conflicts in Israel/Palestine, as well as providing challenges and insight into the broader questions that exist at the interface between religiosity and formations of the secular.","Anthropology,Ethnography",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1302131962l/10003675.jpg,019975120X,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10003675-unsettling-gaza,219,3.5,0,"Unsettling Gaza: Secular Liberalism, Radical Religion, and the Israeli Settlement Project",4

"Amit Goswami,Deepak Chopra",Paperback,"Does God exist? Can spirituality be integrated with science? Is happiness possible? Do miracles really happen? Not only does ,The Visionary Window, answer ""yes"" to all of these questions, but it skillfully combines the fields of philosophy, cosmology, religion, and psychology to form a new way of thinking about science and spirituality. Stepping beyond the classic work of prominent seventies physicist Fritjof Capra, Goswami details his own pioneering exploration of science and spirit, revealing the complete integration between modern science and spiritual traditions. Using stories and colorful examples from pop culture, Goswami addresses complex issues in language and terminology easily accessible to the lay reader. He provides quantum physics-based theory and new experimental data verifying the metaphysical truth that exists when employed in the context of a new science, science within the primacy of consciousness. With a new holistic worldview, Goswami also discusses the creativity of the body to self heal; the power of spiritual practice and how to choose a meditative path; and the five stages of spiritual growth, culminating in the ability to transcend the physical laws of nature. Readers, scientists and spiritual leaders alike will find answers to many of life's deepest mysteries.","Science,Spirituality,Nonfiction,Philosophy",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1357613458l/100039.jpg,083560845X,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100039.The_Visionary_Window,339,4.02,8,The Visionary Window: A Quantum Physicist's Guide to Enlightenment,98
Mark Monmonier,Hardcover,"For years Mark Monmonier, ""a prose stylist of no mean ability or charm"" according to the ,Washington Post,, has delighted readers with his insightful understanding of cartography as an art and technology that is both deceptive and revealing. Now he turns his focus to the story of political cartography and the redrawing of congressional districts. His title ,Bushmanders and Bullwinkles, combines ,gerrymander, with the surname of the president who actively tolerated racial gerrymandering and draws attention to the ridiculously shaped congressional districts that evoke the antlers of the moose who shared the cartoon spotlight with Rocky the Flying Squirrel.,Written from the perspective of a cartographer rather than a political scientist, ,Bushmanders and Bullwinkles, examines the political tales maps tell when votes and power are at stake. Monmonier shows how redistricting committees carve out favorable election districts for themselves and their allies; how disgruntled politicians use shape to challenge alleged racial gerrymanders; and how geographic information systems can make reapportionment a controversial process with outrageous products. He also explores controversies over the proper roles of natural boundaries, media maps, census enumeration, and ethnic identity. Raising important questions about Supreme Court decisions in regulating redistricting, Monmonier asks if the focus on form rather than function may be little more than a distraction from larger issues like election reform. ,Characterized by the same wit and clarity as Monmonier's previous books, ,Bushmanders and Bullwinkles, is essential background for understanding what might prove the most contentious political debate of the new decade.","Science,Geography,Geography,Cartography,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348133526l/1000403.jpg,226534243,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1000403.Bushmanders_and_Bullwinkles,216,3.31,3,Bushmanders and Bullwinkles: How Politicians Manipulate Electronic Maps and Census Data to Win Elections,13

Marcus Chown,Hardcover,"The two towering achievements of modern physics are quantum theory and Einstein's general theory of relativity. Together, they explain virtually everything about the world we live in. But, almost a century after their advent, most people haven't the slightest clue what either is about. Did you know that there's so much empty space inside matter that the entire human race could be squeezed into the volume of a sugar cube? Or that you grow old more quickly on the top floor of a building than on the ground floor? And did you realize that 1 per cent of the static on a TV tuned between stations is the relic of the Big Bang? These and many other remarkable facts about the world are direct consequences of quantum physics and relativity. Quantum theory has literally made the modern world possible. Not only has it given us lasers, computers, and nuclear reactors, but it has provided an explanation of why the sun shines and why the ground beneath our feet is solid. Despite this, however, quantum theory and relativity remain a patchwork of fragmented ideas, vaguely understood at best and often utterly mysterious. average person. Author Marcus Chown emphatically disagrees. As Einstein himself said, Most of the fundamental ideas of science are essentially simple and may, as a rule, be expressed in a language comprehensible to everyone. If you think that the marvels of modern physics have passed you by, it is not too late. In Chown's capable hands, quantum physics and relativity are not only painless but downright fun. So sit back, relax, and get comfortable as an adept and experienced science communicator brings you quickly up to speed on some of the greatest ideas in the history of human thought.","Science,Science,Physics,Nonfiction,Science,Popular Science,Reference",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348477512l/100044.jpg,309096227,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/100044.The_Quantum_Zoo,200,4.05,27,The Quantum Zoo: A Tourist's Guide to the Neverending Universe,164

"Henri Frankfort,Samuel Noah Kramer",Paperback,"This classic study clearly establishes a fundamental difference in viewpoint between the peoples of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. By examining the forms of kingship which evolved in the two countries, Frankfort discovered that beneath resemblances fostered by similar cultural growth and geographical location lay differences based partly upon the natural conditions under which each society developed. The river flood which annually renewed life in the Nile Valley gave Egyptians a cheerful confidence in the permanence of established things and faith in life after death. Their Mesopotamian contemporaries, however, viewed anxiously the harsh, hostile workings of nature. ,Frank's superb work, first published in 1948 and now supplemented with a preface by Samuel Noah Kramer, demonstrates how the Egyptian and Mesopotamian attitudes toward nature related to their concept of kingship. In both countries the people regarded the king as their mediator with the gods, but in Mesopotamia the king was only the foremost citizen, while in Egypt the ruler was a divine descendant of the gods and the earthly representative of the God Horus.

Albert Einstein,Paperback,"In 1905, a German technical journal, ,Annalen der Physik, ,published a remarkable paper by a young clerk in the patent office at Berne, Switzerland. The clerk was Albert Einstein. The paper outlined his Special Theory of Relativity, a revolutionary physical theory which discarded the concept of absolute motion in favor of relative motion in the context of a four-dimensional continuum of space-time. It proved to be the most profound revolution in physics since Newton.,About ten years later, building on his earlier work, Einstein formulated the General Theory of Relativity in which he offered a new solution to the great problem of gravitation, postulating the non-Euclidean character of the space-time continuum. Together, the two theories constituted a radically reoriented way of looking at the physical universe, an approach that solved many of the unresolved difficulties of classical mechanics and paved the way for great advances in 20th-century physics. ,This concise volume contains two addresses by Dr. Einstein outlining aspects of the theories. ,Ether and Relativity, (1920), delivered at the University of Leyden, discusses the properties demanded of the ether of space by the theory of relativity. ,Geometry and Experience ,(1921), given at the Prussian Academy of Sciences, describes the limits within which the Euclidean or any other practical geometric system can be held to be approximately true in connection with the concept of a finite universe.,Both lectures are reprinted here complete and unabridged; both express elegant ideas in simple prose devoid of complicated equations or abstruse terminology; both offer scientists and laypeople unparalleled insight into the seminal thinking of the 20th century's greatest physicist. ,

Excerpt: Aspasia (ca. 470 BC ca. 400 BC, Greek: ) was a Milesian woman who was famous for her involvement with the Athenian statesman Pericles. Very little is known about the details of her life. She spent most of her adult life in Athens, and she may have influenced Pericles and Athenian politics. She is mentioned in the writings of Plato, Aristophanes, Xenophon, and other authors of the day. Ancient writers also reported that Aspasia was a brothel keeper and a harlot, although these accounts are disputed by modern scholars, on the grounds that many of the writers were comic poets concerned with defaming Pericles. Some researchers question even the historical tradition that she was a hetaera, or courtesan, and have suggested that she may actually have been married to Pericles. Aspasia had a son by Pericles, Pericles the Younger, who later became a general in the Athenian military and was executed after the Battle of Arginusae. She is believed to have become the courtesan of Lysicles, another Athenian statesman and general, following the death of Pericles the Elder. Aspasia was born in the Ionian Greek city of Miletus (in the modern province of Aydn, Turkey). Little is known about her family except that her father's name was Axiochus, although it is evident that she must have belonged to a wealthy family, for only the well-to-do could have afforded the excellent education that she received.

Plato,ebook,"This edition is written in English. However, there is a running Chinese Traditional thesaurus at the bottom of each page for the more difficult English words highlighted in the text. There are many editions of Lesser Hippias. This edition would be useful if you would like to enrich your Chinese Traditional-English vocabulary, whether for self-improvement or for preparation in advanced of college examinations. Websters edition of this classic is organized to expose the reader to a maximum number of difficult and potentially ambiguous English words. Rare or idiosyncratic words and expressions are given lower priority compared to difficult, yet commonly used English words. Rather than supply a single translation, many words are translated for a variety of meanings in Chinese Traditional, allowing readers to better grasp the ambiguity of English without using the notes as a pure translation crutch. Having the reader decipher a words meaning within context serves to improve vocabulary retention and understanding. Each page covers words not already highlighted on previous pages. This edition is helpful to Chinese Traditional-speaking students enrolled in an English Language Program (ELP), an English as a Foreign Language (EFL) program, an English as a Second Language Program (ESL), or in a TOEFL or TOEIC preparation program. Students who are actively building their vocabularies in Chinese Traditional or English may also find this useful for Advanced Placement (AP) tests.

"Rudolf Steiner,N. Macbeth",Paperback,"12 Lectures, Leipzig, September 2-14, 1908 (CW 106),Rudolf Steiner emphasizes the astonishing and special relationship between our own time and that of ancient Egypt--how, in the natural rhythm of the ages, the so-called third post-Atlantian (Egyptian) epoch is mirrored by the fifth (present) epoch. In this sense, today it is especially relevant to look at ancient Egypt with fresh eyes. The evolution of Western civilization has been profoundly influenced by Egyptian myths through the Greek mysteries. Because of other influences, however, this heritage has degenerated; thinking has mummified and and myth has all but disappeared. Consequently, it is important to revive the seed of goodness passed down to us from ancient Egypt.,Through true imagination, it is our task to renew human knowledge related to the creative forces in nature, which the Egyptians attempted through the Osiris-Isis myth, and the Greeks through the myth of Demeter. This is what Rudolf Steiner attempts in this lecture cycle.,Steiner's subjects include: experiences of Egyptian initiations; esoteric anatomy and physiology; the stages of evolution of the human form; and much more. The final lecture is on the Christ impulse as the conqueror of matter.,This volume is a translation from German of �,�gyptische Mythen und Mysterien im Verh�ltnis zu den wirkenden Geisteskr�ften der Gegenwart,� (GA 106).,C O N T E N T S,Lecture 1.

"H.P. Lovecraft,Wayne June,Fred Godsmark",Audio CD,"Howard Phillips Lovecraft, has been hailed by literary critics as the inventor of modern horror, and a cultivating force behind such modern writers as Robert Bloch (Psycho), Wes Craven (The Craft, Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream), and Stephen King (Pet Semetary, Carrie, Children of the Corn), just to name a few. ,The Rats In The Walls: After its complete restoration, the narrator of this tale moves into his ancestral family home. Soon afterward, however, he begins to hear noises in the walls. Suspecting rats, he sets out traps but finds these vermin are not the kind so easily dispatched. One of the all-time creepiest of Lovecraft's tales. ,The Shunned House: In the city of Providence stands an antique home of which everyone whispers. Never called haunted exactly, it is known as a place unlucky, one in which people have supposedly died in alarmingly great numbers. This is what Lovecraft's narrator tells us, just before he and his uncle begin a series of investigations into the old place, a place with a terrible odor, one that is stronger in the basement than any place else. ,The Music Of Eric Zann: In the city of Lights, an impoverished student hears incredible music coming from peaked garret overhead. He knows little of the violin, but is certain from the fantastic pieces he hears night after night that he is in the presence of a highly original genius. But, it isn't long before he finds himself wondering, why does Zann only play at night? And why every night? ,Brought to life again by the incomparable Wayne June, come horrors from the mind of the Master himself, in the way that only he can.

Paolo Mancosu,Hardcover,"Paolo Mancosu presents a series of innovative studies in the history and the philosophy of logic and mathematics in the first half of the twentieth century. ,The Adventure of Reason ,is divided into five main sections: history of logic (from Russell to Tarski); foundational issues (Hilbert's program, constructivity, Wittgenstein, Godel); mathematics and phenomenology (Weyl, Becker, Mahnke); nominalism (Quine, Tarski); semantics (Tarski, Carnap, Neurath). Mancosu exploits extensive untapped archival sources to make available a wealth of new material that deepens in significant ways our understanding of these fascinating areas of modern intellectual history. At the same time, the book is a contribution to recent philosophical debates, in particular on the prospects for a successful nominalist reconstruction of mathematics, the nature of finitist intuition, the viability of alternative definitions of logical consequence, and the extent to which phenomenology can hope to account for the exact sciences.","Philosophy,Logic,Science,Mathematics",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348549487l/10009603.jpg,199546533,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10009603-the-adventure-of-reason,618,5,0,"The Adventure of Reason: Interplay Between Philosophy of Mathematics and Mathematical Logic, 1900-1940",3

Stephen Toulmin,Paperback,"In the seventeenth century, a vision arose which was to captivate the Western imagination for the next three hundred years: the vision of Cosmopolis, a society as rationally ordered as the Newtonian view of nature. While fueling extraordinary advances in all fields of human endeavor, this vision perpetuated a hidden yet persistent agenda: the delusion that human nature and society could be fitted into precise and manageable rational categories. Stephen Toulmin confronts that agenda—its illusions and its consequences for our present and future world.,""By showing how different the last three centuries would have been if Montaigne, rather than Descartes, had been taken as a starting point, Toulmin helps destroy the illusion that the Cartesian quest for certainty is intrinsic to the nature of science or philosophy.""—Richard M. Rorty, University of Virginia,""[Toulmin] has now tackled perhaps his most ambitious theme of all. . . . His aim is nothing less than to lay before us an account of both the origins and the prospects of our distinctively modern world.

"Rosalind Gill,Christina Scharff",Hardcover,"This volume brings together twenty original essays on the changes and continuities in gender relations and intersecting politics of sexuality, race, class and location. The book is located in debates about contemporary culture at a moment of rapid technological change, global interconnectedness and the growing cultural dominance of neoliberalism and postfeminism. The collection traverses disciplines, spaces and approaches. It is marked by an extraordinarily wide focus, ranging from analyses of celebrity magazines and makeover shows to examinations of the experiences of young female migrants, 'mail order brides' and young women who repudiate feminism. The contributions are united by their attempts to think through the ways in which experiences and representations of femininity are changing in the twenty-first century. Are we seeing new femininities? Are neoliberalism and postfeminism constructing new identities and subjectivities? What kinds of analytic tools and cultural politics are needed to critically engage with the current moment?

Ladislas Farago,Paperback,"“Rich in humor, confidence men, and charm.""—,
  ,New York Times,
, Known for his best-selling military histories, Ladislas Farago also wrote a witty tribute to his homeland, ,Strictly from Hungary,. Noting that Hungary has produced some of the world's most renowned artists, scientists, and financiers as well as its share of world-class con-artists, charlatans, and rakes, Farago sets out to explain just how one tiny country can be responsible for so much talent, both good and bad. Using stories from his days as a struggling writer in the bustling café scenes of Budapest and New York City, Farago demonstrates the Hungarian knack for remaining irrepressible and optimistic even in the face of catastrophe. Here we meet Zoltan, a fellow Bohemian who presents his astonished benefactor with a play ""about nothing,"" a theme later made famous by another writer of Hungarian descent, Jerry Seinfeld. Farago also introduces us to ""Baby Kiss,"" a vivacious Hungarian beauty queen, and the story of how she ended up in Fort Worth, Texas; Orkeny, a double agent for America at the height of the Cold War who ""spiced up"" his reports to keep everyone happy, and the author's own experience getting mustered into the supposedly non-existent Royal Hungarian Army. Farago's reminiscence validates what most Hungarians believe: that Hungary is the center of the world and that everyone has some connection to the land of the Magyars. In that spirit, Farago learns that George Washington himself was ""strictly from Hungary."" This edition is introduced by the author's son, who shows that the same vibrant spirit described by his father remains the hallmark of the Hungarian temperament.","Cultural,Hungary",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1180186282l/1007712._SY475_.jpg,1594160066,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1007712.Strictly_from_Hungary,216,3.25,3,Strictly from Hungary,8

Le annaffia ogni giorno, e tiene più puliti quei cespugli che le sue unghie, sempre sporche di grasso. Usa un oliatore a becco lungo per concimarle alla base e una pistola per la verniciatura contro i parassiti. Quel giardino è il suo paese dei balocchi, dove tornare a essere un bambino che gioca a fare il meccanico delle rose».,Il protagonista di questo libro si nasconde letteralmente tra le righe. Abita non più di una frase del primo capitolo, e negli altri fa la sua comparsa a tempo debito. Eppure al centro del romanzo c'è lui: il protagonista assente, che proprio restando ai margini delle vite degli altri acquista una paradossale centralità.,La sua storia è raccontata attraverso le storie delle persone che sono state importanti per lui, nell'Iran dagli anni Venti ai giorni nostri: il padre, il cugino, la moglie, la figlia, una donna amata.,Chinandosi su ognuno di questi personaggi, e narrando le loro vicende come se fosse sulla loro spalla, l'autore riesce a farci entrare in profondità nelle tante vite che formano una vita, e un mondo. ,Akbar - che vive in un paese ai bordi del deserto dove si estrae la migliore essenza delle rose di Persia - è un capofamiglia religioso e rispettato e trova un modo tutto suo per rimediare ai torti del destino che gli ha rubato un figlio.,Khodadad è appena un ragazzino quando fugge di casa in cerca di se stesso, nei giorni dell'anniversario del martirio dell'Imam Hossein e dei suoi settantadue seguaci.,Donya ha conosciuto la felicità e la disperazione, prima di andare in sposa a un uomo che ha il doppio dei suoi anni. ,Mahtab stava per laurearsi in medicina e iniziare una nuova vita, quando è incappata nei Guardiani della Rivoluzione.,Laleh ha il nome d'un fiore - quello del martirio - e forse è una «pazza d'amore»: è lei, dal letto di un ospedale, in un lucido delirio, a tirare inconsapevolmente i fili di tutte le storie, e a restituire il volto contraddittorio del suo amato, il meccanico delle rose.,Il quadro dunque è compiuto. Ma chi è al centro di quel quadro? L'uomo che dà il titolo al libro ha creduto - come tutti - di essere protagonista della sua vita, ed è stato una comparsa in quella degli altri. ,Quel che è certo è che sullo sfondo, dietro le tante figure, resta un Paese riconoscibilissimo ma mai nominato, per rispetto di chi - vivendo nei suoi confini - non può nominarlo.","Cultural,Iran",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1330870045l/10078103.jpg,8806196839,9790000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10078103-il-meccanico-delle-rose,280,4.1,13,Il meccanico delle rose,49
Michael S. Sanders,Paperback,"From Here,You Can't See Paris, is a sweet, leisurely exploration of the life of Les Arques (population 159), a hilltop village in a remote corner of France, untouched by the modern era. It is a story of a dying village's struggle to survive, of a dead artist whose legacy began its rebirth, and of chef Jacques Ratier and his wife, Noëlle, whose bustling restaurant—the village's sole business—has helped ensure its future. ,The author set out to explore the inner workings of a French restaurant kitchen but ended up stumbling onto a wider, much richer world. Whether uncovering the darker secrets of making foie gras, hearing a chef confess his doubts about the Michelin star system, or absorbing the lore of the land around a farmhouse kitchen table after a boar hunt, Michael Sanders learned that life in Les Arques was anything but sleepy. Through the eyes of the author and his family, the reader enters this world, discovers its still-vibrant traditions of food, cooking, and rural living, and comes to know the village's history, sharing along the way an American family's adventures as they find their way in a place that is sometimes lonely, often wondrous, and always fascinating.","Travel,Cultural,France,Nonfiction,Food and Drink,Food,Autobiography,Memoir,Food and Drink,Food Writing,Food and Drink,Culinary,Food and Drink,Cooking,Cultural,Food and Drink,Foodie",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348985125l/1007810.jpg,60959207,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1007810.From_Here_You_Can_t_See_Paris,352,3.73,48,"From Here, You Can't See Paris: Seasons of a French Village and Its Restaurant",658

Patricia Fara,Hardcover,"An Entertainment for Angels, rather than for Men, one observer called electricity, and it proved to be the most significant scientific discovery of the Enlightenment. Lecturers attracted huge audiences who marveled at sparkling fountains, flaming drinks, pirouetting dancers, and electrified boys. Flamboyant experimenters made chains of soldiers leap into the air, while wealthy women titillated their admirers with a sensational electric kiss. Optimists predicted that this strange power of nature would cure illnesses, improve crop production, even bring the dead back to life. ,An Entertainment for Angels, tells the story of how electricity charged the eighteenth-century imagination. With contemporary illustrations and engaging prose, Patricia Fara vividly portrays the struggles to understand the unusual and exciting effects that electrical experiments were producing.,One of the heroes of the story is Benjamin Franklin, renowned on both sides of the Atlantic as an expert on electricity, who introduced lightning rods to protect tall buildings, pioneered techniques to treat paralyzed patients, and developed one of the most successful explanations of this mysterious phenomenon. Others include Luigi Galvani, whose electrical research on frogs and animals makes for grisly reading but led to the discovery of direct current electricity; and Alessandro Volta, who--with Napoleon's enthusiastic support--became one of Europe's leading scientific practitioners and invented the world's first battery.","Nonfiction,Science,History Of Science,Science,History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347563624l/1007860.jpg,231131488,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1007860.An_Entertainment_for_Angels,192,3.07,5,An Entertainment for Angels: Electricity in the Enlightenment,42

James Naremore,Paperback,"""Film noir"" evokes memories of stylish, cynical, black-&-white movies from the 40s & 50s--melodramas about private eyes, femmes fatales, criminal gangs & lovers on the run. ,More Than Night, discusses such pictures. It also shows that the central term is more complex & paradoxical than realized. Film noir refers both to an important cinematic legacy & to an idea projected onto the past. This wide-ranging cultural history offers an original approach to the subject, as well as new production information & commentary on scores of films, including ,Double Indemnity,, ,The Third Man,, & ,Out of the Past,, & such neo-noirs as ,Chinatown,, ,Pulp Fiction, & ,Devil in a Blue Dress,. Naremore discusses film noir as a term in criticism; as an expression of artistic modernism; as a symptom of Hollywood censorship & politics in the 40s; as a market strategy; as an evolving style; as a cinema about race & nationality & as an idea that circulates across all information technologies. This interdisciplinary book has valuable things to say not only about film & tv, but also about modern literature, the fine arts & popular culture in general. In a field where much of what's published is superficial & derivative, this work is certain to be received as a definitive treatment.","Culture,Film,Nonfiction,Mystery,Noir,Media Tie In,History,Textbooks,Academic,School",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387665170l/1007865.jpg,520212940,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1007865.More_than_Night,359,4.06,14,More than Night: Film Noir in its Contexts,221

Without warning, Nyle's modest world fills with protective masks, evacuations, contaminated food, disruptions, and mistrust.,Nyle adjusts to the changes. As long as the fallout continues blowing to the East, Nyle, Gran, and the farm can go on. But into this uncertain haven stumble Ezra Trent and his mother, ""refugees"" from the heart of the accident, who take temporary shelter in the back bedroom of Nyle's house.,The back bedroom is the dying room: It took her mother when Nyle was six; it stole away her grandfather just two years ago.

Now I am about to go to Ticino once again, to live for a while as a hermit in nature and in my work."" In 1920, after settling in the Ticino mountain village of Montagnola, he published Wandering, a love letter to this magic-garden world that can be read as a meditation on his attempt to begin a new life.

Pier Vittorio Aureli,Paperback,"Architectural form reconsidered in light of a unitary conception of architecture and the city.,In ,The Possibility of an Absolute Architecture,, Pier Vittorio Aureli proposes that a sharpened formal consciousness in architecture is a precondition for political, cultural, and social engagement with the city. Aureli uses the term absolute not in the conventional sense of ""pure,"" but to denote something that is resolutely itself after being separated from its other. In the pursuit of the possibility of an absolute architecture, the other is the space of the city, its extensive organization, and its government. Politics is agonism through separation and confrontation; the very condition of architectural form is to separate and be separated. Through its act of separation and being separated, architecture reveals at once the essence of the city and the essence of itself as political form: the city as the composition of (separate) parts. Aureli revisits the work of four architects whose projects were advanced through the making of architectural form but whose concern was the city at large: Andrea Palladio, Giovanni Battista Piranesi, Etienne Louis-Boull'e, and Oswald Mathias Ungers. The work of these architects, Aureli argues, addressed the transformations of the modern city and its urban implications through the elaboration of specific and strategic architectural forms. Their projects for the city do not take the form of an overall plan but are expressed as an ""archipelago"" of site-specific interventions.","Architecture,Philosophy,Theory,Nonfiction,Cities,Urbanism,European Literature,Italian Literature,Art,History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348406988l/10079601.jpg,262515792,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10079601-the-possibility-of-an-absolute-architecture,251,4.21,5,The Possibility of an Absolute Architecture,154

From crazy parties to glittered junkies and man-eating strippers, Amy has chronicled what life was like back in the days of excess and debauchery. It is not just a fascinating look into an amusing time in pop culture, but also details the mindset of a young woman trying to find confidence and self-worth in a life full of pain and chaos. ,The party came screeching to a halt when the Grunge movement took over and heroin became more prominent.

Lewis V. Thomas,Paperback,"Turkish is the primary language of some thirty million people. Anyone concerned with current social, political, and cultural developments in Turkey knows that a practical understanding of the basic patterns of modern Turkish is an invaluable skill that until now has been difficult to attain without extensive training.,This superb grammar and exercise text, used successfully for years in Princeton University, enables English-speaking students — in and out of the classroom — to gain a quick and thorough understanding of modern Turkish. In a carefully arranged sequence of 23 lessons, Lewis V. Thomas, late Professor of Oriental Studies at Princeton, presents thorough coverage that allows the student to begin to use the basic patterns of modern Turkish without time-consuming and expensive private instruction.,The method of instruction was devised after an extensive analysis of results in Princeton classrooms, and relies on exercises at the end of each lesson to test the student's grasp of the material. Beginning with the alphabet and numbers, Professor Thomas offers clear, concise coverage of articles, adjectives and nouns, common infinitives, personal pronouns, and elementary verbs. As the student's comprehension of basic elements develops, further lessons deal with more complicated subjects such as the possessive construction, past general verbs, postpositions, the partitive, progressive verb forms, and abbreviating verb forms. A complete Turkish-English glossary translates new vocabulary occurring in the exercises.,Norman Itzkowitz, Professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University, has skillfully made the necessary revisions and additions to complete Professor Thomas' work. For anyone who needs to communicate in this important and influential language, Professor Thomas' proven course, now in an inexpensive paperback edition, is the most effective method available.","Humanities,Language,Reference,Cultural,Turkish,Nonfiction,Humanities,Linguistics",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347383587l/1007998.jpg,486250644,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1007998.Elementary_Turkish,208,3.78,5,Elementary Turkish,65

Antonia Fraser,Paperback,"She was the quintessential queen: statuesque, regal, dazzlingly beautiful. Her royal birth gave her claim to the thrones of two nations; her marriage to the young French dauphin promised to place a third glorious crown on her noble head. Instead, Mary Stuart became the victim of her own impulsive heart, scandalizing her world with a foolish passion that would lead to abduction, rape, and even murder. Betrayed by those she most trusted, she would be lured into a deadly game of power, only to lose to her envious and unforgiving cousin, Elizabeth I. Here is her story, a queen who lost a throne for love, a monarch pampered and adored even as she was led to her beheading, the unforgettable woman who became a legend for all time.","History,Biography,Nonfiction,Cultural,Scotland,Historical,European Literature,British Literature,Biography Memoir,English History,Tudor Period,Literature,16th Century,Womens",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1390268536l/10079.jpg,038531129X,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10079.Mary_Queen_of_Scots,568,3.93,404,Mary Queen of Scots,17053
Audrey Terras,Hardcover,"Graph theory meets number theory in this stimulating book. Ihara zeta functions of finite graphs are reciprocals of polynomials, sometimes in several variables. Analogies abound with number-theoretic functions such as Riemann/Dedekind zeta functions. For example, there is a Riemann hypothesis (which may be false) and prime number theorem for graphs. Explicit constructions of graph coverings use Galois theory to generalize Cayley and Schreier graphs. Then non-isomorphic simple graphs with the same zeta are produced, showing you cannot hear the shape of a graph. The spectra of matrices such as the adjacency and edge adjacency matrices of a graph are essential to the plot of this book, which makes connections with quantum chaos and random matrix theory, plus expander/Ramanujan graphs of interest in computer science. Pitched at beginning graduate students, the book will also appeal to researchers.

"Rick H. Hoyle,Charles M. Judd",Hardcover,"RESEARCH METHODS IN SOCIAL RELATIONS offers a compelling, problem-focused perspective on social science methods. The authors discuss the influence of personal and cultural values on which questions are asked, how they are asked, and how they are addressed in the opening chapter and use this perspective in discussions of specific methods throughout the book. This focus on the importance of conscience and conviction in research on social behavior is a unique and enduring feature of this new Seventh Edition. Ideal for advanced undergraduates and graduate students, this Seventh Edition covers all the major research methods used by social scientists, with special attention devoted to methods that are well-suited to the study of real world social problems. Most of the examples drawn from the published literature or developed specifically for the book concern a social problem for which social science research is relevant. Your students will see how social science research can be used to address questions such as: To what factors can the escalation of violence in schools be attributed? Why, in the midst of an AIDS epidemic to people engage in risky sexual behavior? Can ethnic prejudice be reduced? As in previous editions, the heart of the book is detailed coverage of a broad array of research methods, ranging from tightly controlled laboratory experimentation to nonintrusive observation of people in theier natural environments.","Psychology,Academic",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1339155505l/1008006.jpg,155061399,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1008006.Research_Methods_in_Social_Relations,592,3.22,0,Research Methods in Social Relations,37

Amy Erdman Farrell,Hardcover,"One of Choice's Significant University Press Titles for Undergraduates, 2010-2011,To be fat hasn't always occasioned the level of hysteria that this condition receives today and indeed was once considered an admirable trait. ,Fat Shame: Stigma and the Fat Body in American Culture, explores this arc, from veneration to shame, examining the historic roots of our contemporary anxiety about fatness. Tracing the cultural denigration of fatness to the mid 19th century, Amy Farrell argues that the stigma associated with a fat body preceded any health concerns about a large body size. Firmly in place by the time the diet industry began to flourish in the 1920s, the development of fat stigma was related not only to cultural anxieties that emerged during the modern period related to consumer excess, but, even more profoundly, to prevailing ideas about race, civilization and evolution. For 19th and early 20th century thinkers, fatness was a key marker of inferiority, of an uncivilized, barbaric, and primitive body. This idea--that fatness is a sign of a primitive person--endures today, fueling both our $60 billion -war on fat- and our cultural distress over the -obesity epidemic.- Farrell draws on a wide array of sources, including political cartoons, popular literature, postcards, advertisements, and physicians' manuals, to explore the link between our historic denigration of fatness and our contemporary concern over obesity. Her work sheds particular light on feminisms' fraught relationship to fatness. From the white suffragists of the early 20th century to contemporary public figures like Oprah Winfrey, Monica Lewinsky, and even the Obama family, Farrell explores the ways that those who seek to shed stigmatized identities--whether of gender, race, ethnicity or class--often take part in weight reduction schemes and fat mockery in order to validate themselves as -civilized.- In sharp contrast to these narratives of fat shame are the ideas of contemporary fat activists, whose articulation of a new vision of the body Farrell explores in depth. This book is significant for anyone concerned about the contemporary -war on fat- and the ways that notions of the -civilized body- continue to legitimate discrimination and cultural oppression.","Nonfiction,Feminism,Fat,Fat Studies,Sociology,History,Health,Fat,Health,Politics,Fat,Fat Acceptance,Social Movements,Social Justice",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1417982238l/10080729.jpg,814727689,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10080729-fat-shame,219,3.93,35,Fat Shame: Stigma and the Fat Body in American Culture,279

Alison Weir,Paperback,"On the night of 10 February 1567 an explosion devastated the Edinburgh residence of Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, second husband of Mary, Queen of Scots. The noise was heard as far away as Holyrood Palace, where Queen Mary was attending a wedding masque. Those arriving at the scene of devastation found, in the garden, the naked corpses of Darnley and his valet. Neither had died in the explosion, but both bodies bore marks of strangulation.,It was clear that they had been murdered and the house destroyed in an attempt to obliterate the evidence. Darnley was not a popular king-consort, but he was regarded by many as having a valid claim to the English throne. For this reason Elizabeth I had opposed his family's longstanding wish to marry him to Mary Stuart, who herself claimed to be the rightful queen of England.,Alison Weir's investigation of Darnley's murder is set against one of the most dramatic periods in British history. Her conclusions shed a brilliant new light on the actions and motives of the conspirators and, in particular, the extent of Mary's own involvement.","History,Nonfiction,Biography,Historical,Cultural,Scotland,English History,Tudor Period,European Literature,British Literature,Crime,True Crime,Literature,16th Century,History,European History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1166113920l/10080.jpg,712664564,9780000000000,https://goodreads.com/book/show/10080.Mary_Queen_of_Scots_and_the_Murder_of_Lord_Darnley,640,4.05,168,Mary Queen of Scots and the Murder of Lord Darnley,5547

Ling denies having seen the victim or the perpetrators, but there is something in her steely demeanor and aristocratic beauty that compels Hackberry to return to her home again and again as the investigation unfolds.
